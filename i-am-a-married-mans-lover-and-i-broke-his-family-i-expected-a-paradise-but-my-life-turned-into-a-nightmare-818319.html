<time>29 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>When someone falls in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with a&nbsp;married person, there’s always a&nbsp;choice whether to&nbsp;continue this <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> and break a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> or&nbsp;to&nbsp;run away from such a&nbsp;dubious relationship. Our today’s heroine is&nbsp;an&nbsp;affair partner of&nbsp;a&nbsp;married man. She broke his family and was sure that their love will flourish on&nbsp;the ashes of&nbsp;her SO’s broken <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. But the woman faced some severe side effects of&nbsp;her actions, and now she regrets everything.</p><p><h2>The woman was sure she was doing everything right.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15c/832/be7af052d18f703ac36a7532e0.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 38, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and this was a&nbsp;confession that was full of&nbsp;<a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> from her side. She started her letter, saying, «I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where&nbsp;I really don’t know what to&nbsp;do. My&nbsp;whole life has taken such a&nbsp;drastic turn, and&nbsp;I appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unprepared for the crash of&nbsp;my&nbsp;illusions. This all will feel like a&nbsp;novel, so&nbsp;I’m sorry for the long letter, but&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;pour my&nbsp;heart out.»</p><p>The woman went&nbsp;on, saying that her partner is&nbsp;54, and their relationship started not in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very fair way. She wrote, «My&nbsp;SO&nbsp;and&nbsp;I have met 6&nbsp;years ago during a&nbsp;joint team building event that our companies were holding together. At&nbsp;that time he&nbsp;was married and had 2&nbsp;kids, 10&nbsp;and 15&nbsp;at that time. I&nbsp;didn’t have family and kids, I&nbsp;also didn’t have any relationship at&nbsp;that time.<br>Firstly, we&nbsp;became really close friends and after some time it&nbsp;all turned into some strong romantic feelings between&nbsp;us. He&nbsp;assured me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;was very unhappy in&nbsp;his marriage, that it&nbsp;was awful and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;mistake. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;leave his wife anyway and was just waiting for a&nbsp;moment when the kids were a&nbsp;little bit older.»</p><p>The woman instantly believed her&nbsp;SO and developed very strong feelings for him. She wrote, «I&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with this man, and&nbsp;I was ready to&nbsp;wait until he&nbsp;ends his marriage. After 2&nbsp;years of&nbsp;our affair we&nbsp;got caught and things were really difficult for some time.»</p><p><h2>After a&nbsp;breakup, things were developing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;moderate way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/149/59c/72f5a0516da52fe3f00b8690a1.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her letter, saying that, since their affair was not a&nbsp;secret anymore, they moved in&nbsp;together and were prepared for building their own new family.</p><p>She explained, «His wife was totally heartbroken, but she decided not to&nbsp;tell the kids about their dad’s affair. We&nbsp;both respected his wife and kids, and we&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;really public with our relationship for a&nbsp;year, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;lay low.<br>My&nbsp;SO&nbsp;first introduced me&nbsp;to&nbsp;his children after about a&nbsp;year. It&nbsp;was difficult for the kids to&nbsp;see their dad happy with another woman, but we&nbsp;eventually got along just fine. We&nbsp;then bought a&nbsp;house and were preparing for getting married. The kids came to&nbsp;visit&nbsp;us often. Things were developing in&nbsp;the best way possible for&nbsp;us. Or&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought.»</p><p><h2>The man’s ex-wife was suffering a&nbsp;lot and her pain was immense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f48/22d/cec2ad5b8aab783d3c13bd55ec.jpg><p>The woman shared, «My&nbsp;fiancé’s ex-wife had a&nbsp;really tough time living through her husband’s infidelity and him leaving. She has always been a&nbsp;stay-at-home mother and had a&nbsp;part-time job. We&nbsp;knew that she had some serious health issues and gained a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;weight. She was completely depressed and isolated.»</p><p>The ex-wife was totally desperate, and it&nbsp;seemed like it&nbsp;would take her a&nbsp;really long time to&nbsp;recover. The woman revealed, «After their breakup she often called my&nbsp;SO, she was crying, she sent him long emails and heartfelt texts, she begged him for another chance to&nbsp;recover their family. My&nbsp;fiancé was guilt-ridden, but he&nbsp;never <a href=# title=communicated data-link=tag>communicated</a> with her outside the things considering the <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> and their kids. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;choice, and that he&nbsp;loved&nbsp;me, that he&nbsp;regretted the pain he&nbsp;has caused her and the children, but it&nbsp;was already done and all he&nbsp;could do&nbsp;is&nbsp;look into the future, without turning backwards.»</p><p><h2>The betrayed woman started to&nbsp;recover, and this was the beginning of&nbsp;an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;an&nbsp;affair relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a83/01c/e7ec5c5866925634b68d44e153.jpg><p>One day, the man’s ex-wife just stopped calling him and sending him long messages. The woman revealed that the ex-spouse just asked her fiancé to&nbsp;co-parent through some parenting app. The woman said, «He&nbsp;never met or&nbsp;heard from her. His oldest son could now drive and if&nbsp;he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;her house to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;his youngest son, the ex&nbsp;was not around. For&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;huge relief.<br>My&nbsp;fiancé’s oldest son informed&nbsp;us that his mom was attending a&nbsp;therapist, and she was doing meditation, yoga, she was also more physically active, she lost weight. The ex&nbsp;also got her full-time job in&nbsp;her professional field and seemed just happy.»</p><p>Then, some detail was uncovered, and the woman’s SO&nbsp;just changed. The woman wrote, «Some time ago, SO’s youngest son started mentioning some „uncle&nbsp;P“ in&nbsp;conversations. This „Uncle&nbsp;P“ was one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;fiancé’s best friends. He&nbsp;once completely cut contact with my&nbsp;SO after our affair was revealed. They haven’t met or&nbsp;spoken to&nbsp;each other since.<br>It&nbsp;turned out that „uncle&nbsp;P“ and fiancé’s ex-wife were now in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship. At&nbsp;the time we&nbsp;found out about this, I&nbsp;also found out&nbsp;I was pregnant. After this revelation, my&nbsp;SO seemed very frustrated, but&nbsp;I just thought it&nbsp;was because of&nbsp;his stress at&nbsp;work, because he&nbsp;changed jobs. Then he&nbsp;started coming home late. He&nbsp;was always on&nbsp;his phone. His behavior was rapidly changing from what&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;see.»</p><p><h2>Things took a&nbsp;very painful turn for the woman in&nbsp;the end.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27c/134/c0d7505b479189da8c86c14323.jpg><p>The woman revealed, «2&nbsp;months ago&nbsp;I got a&nbsp;call from my&nbsp;SO, he&nbsp;was calling from the police station, and he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;pick him&nbsp;up. It&nbsp;turned out he&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;at&nbsp;his ex-wife’s house late in&nbsp;the night and got into a&nbsp;fight with his ex-friend. He&nbsp;even accused his ex-wife of&nbsp;cheating with his former best friend.<br>My&nbsp;SO&nbsp;had a&nbsp;real mental breakdown. It&nbsp;was insane. He&nbsp;has always been a&nbsp;calm person. It&nbsp;all was looking like he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;totally different person. He&nbsp;seemed obsessed with his ex-wife, he&nbsp;was stalking her <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, he&nbsp;was asking his kids and family members what the two of&nbsp;them were up&nbsp;to.»</p><p>The woman revealed that her partner agreed to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;therapist, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;therapy. They both have a&nbsp;son now and the woman sincerely thought things would get better and the birth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby will help them to&nbsp;move forward. But she confessed that their relationship is&nbsp;still rocky.</p><p>She said, «I&nbsp;feel that his heart and mind are no&nbsp;longer in&nbsp;our relationship, and I&nbsp;am thinking about leaving him. I&nbsp;still love him and we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby. I&nbsp;really want&nbsp;us to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. I&nbsp;understand all the pain we&nbsp;have caused, and our way has not been easy, but we&nbsp;went too far.»</p><p>And here’s yet another family dilemma, which made the heroine of&nbsp;this story have really mixed feelings about everything: from being desperate and feeling guilty, to&nbsp;realizing that her tough solution was the only way out from the situation.
