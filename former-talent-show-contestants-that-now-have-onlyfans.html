She infamously introduced herself as “Trish like fish.” While rapping was certainly not her forte, she has completely taken over TikTok with her mukbangs and “what I eat in a day” videos and is never shy to voice her opinions. Trisha now has quite the following on OnlyFans, posting exclusive content for<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> just $5 a month.</a> She also has another page where she posts explicit content for free.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/trishapaytas/status/1335332943452020738</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH TRISHA PAYTAS’ CRINGEY ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’ AUDITION THAT HAD HOWARD STERN IN LOVE</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mason-noise>Mason Noise</h3><p>You probably best remember Mason Noise for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting into it with Simon Cowell </a>on The X Factor. According to the Daily Star, he then turned to OnlyFans in 2019 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with his girlfriend Megan Rose</a> to “show people how you can really make love and how you can really worship each other.” It is unclear if he is still posting content on OnlyFans since his Instagram now focuses on healing and meditation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEoPjrKgJdD/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-liam-halewood>Liam Halewood&nbsp;</h3><p>Liam Halewood auditioned for The X Factor and though he did not make it very far in the competition, he certainly made his mark. He did a few reality show appearances before having <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">£20k of cosmetic surgery</a> after he grew tired of being told he looked like comedian Alan Carr. In February of 2019, Liam joined OnlyFans after saying that he doesn’t want television stars to fall into the same trap he did spending all of his money.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BuG9OzsgeTQ/?hl=en</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tyshawn-colquitt>Tyshawn Colquitt</h3><p>Tyshawn Colquitt felt like he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrongly eliminated</a> from The Voice in 2018. He did gay porn films to pay for college where he discovered his love for singing. “I feel like my elimination was not fair,” he said after his elimination. “I hate that my dark past took this opportunity away from me and my family.” He started an OnlyFans account<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> to pay for musical expenses.</a> He charges $25 per month.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCxIdlTp11Q/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ash-edelman>Ash Edelman</h3><p>Ash Edelman previously competed on Britain’s Got Talent with the group Forbidden Nights.
