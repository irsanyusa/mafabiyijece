<time>09 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>We&nbsp;all know that adapting literature to&nbsp;film is&nbsp;no&nbsp;easy task. The possibilities are endless and you can experiment to&nbsp;get the best results; however, it’s very difficult to&nbsp;please everyone. As&nbsp;for the characters, it’s always hard to&nbsp;meet the expectations and descriptions of&nbsp;the authors. Of&nbsp;course, the Twilight saga, written by&nbsp;Stephenie Meyer, is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception. In&nbsp;the books, the main character, Bella Swan, narrates the story, and it’s through her eyes that we&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know the rest of&nbsp;the characters. Even though the movies generally did a&nbsp;very good job at&nbsp;adapting the story, there are a&nbsp;few details that make some of&nbsp;the characters look slightly different from the ones that readers met through the books.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>wants to&nbsp;show you the most striking examples of&nbsp;the differences in&nbsp;appearance between the characters in&nbsp;the book and in&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>1. Bella Swan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de6/cc0/4dd1395a158057a3a609fdc295.jpg><p>The main character of&nbsp;the saga, <a href=#>Bella Swan</a>, is&nbsp;described in&nbsp;the books as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lonely young woman with no&nbsp;taste for fashion. Still, she is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;be&nbsp;attractive, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rather strange, mysterious way. Her hair is&nbsp;straight and sleek, her eyes are widely spaced apart, and her lips are too thick for her thin jawline. Generally speaking, it&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;denied that <a href=# title="Kristen Stewart" data-link=tag>Kristen Stewart</a> looks strikingly close to&nbsp;Bella, at&nbsp;least if&nbsp;we&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;the description made in&nbsp;the books. Still, it’s also true that Stewart’s face is&nbsp;more “balanced” than the character’s face in&nbsp;the books, which is&nbsp;also what makes her beautiful. Also, in&nbsp;the first film, her hair is&nbsp;not straight, it’s wavy.</p><p><h2>2. Edward Cullen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/156/a90/af85b95824919a274449a3d739.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the book, the other main character, <a href=#>Edward Cullen</a>, is&nbsp;described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;creature of&nbsp;unspeakable beauty, and on&nbsp;several occasions, Bella compares him to&nbsp;the Greek demigod, Adonis. When talking about his skin in&nbsp;the book, Bella says that it&nbsp;looks and feels like marble: extremely white, hard as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock, and cold as&nbsp;ice. His hair, in&nbsp;Bella’s words, is&nbsp;always messy and bronze-colored, and his features are perfect and angular. Actually, the decision to&nbsp;have <a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a> play the vampire was a&nbsp;wise one since the actor’s physical similarities to&nbsp;the character are so&nbsp;striking. The only significant difference is&nbsp;in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;clothing since, in&nbsp;the books, Edward Cullen is&nbsp;known for always wearing a&nbsp;light-colored leather jacket, which is&nbsp;not really the case in&nbsp;the movies.</p><p><h2>3. Renesmee Cullen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30d/a12/38017d5da4afff464404549623.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the book, Bella and Edward’s <a href=#>daughter</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby of&nbsp;breathtaking beauty. She has her father’s features and hair color but with her grandfather Charlie’s curls. She’s got brown eyes, which she inherited from Bella. Her skin is&nbsp;warm but strong like a&nbsp;vampire’s and glows when exposed to&nbsp;the sun. The girl grows very quickly, far more than any regular baby. It’s actually because of&nbsp;this very reason that when producers were looking for an&nbsp;actress to&nbsp;play the role in&nbsp;the movie, they realized they’d have to&nbsp;use special effects if&nbsp;they wanted the character to&nbsp;resemble its description. The result was a&nbsp;strange mixture between the face of&nbsp;the real actress and an&nbsp;artificial face that gives her an&nbsp;unnatural appearance. This being said, she clearly did not look very similar to&nbsp;the character in&nbsp;the book.</p><p><h2>4. Jacob Black</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f0/088/2fee6f53fd94b693a59eecf8c6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Stephenie Meyer’s books, the werewolf, <a href=#>Jacob Black</a>, is&nbsp;described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very attractive Native American of&nbsp;the Quileute tribe. He’s supposed to&nbsp;have reddish skin. Throughout the books, as&nbsp;his character evolves, so&nbsp;does his physique. Not only does his body develop to&nbsp;leave behind that sort of&nbsp;childish look that initially distinguished him from the rest of&nbsp;the characters, but he&nbsp;also becomes a&nbsp;6-foot-tall man of&nbsp;enormous strength. When Bella meets him for the first time, she can’t help but notice that he&nbsp;has long, shiny hair tied with a&nbsp;garter at&nbsp;the nape of&nbsp;his neck.</p><p><h2>5. Charlie Swan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ec/cd5/4b93b3513ebab3b844fe2ec7a1.jpg><p>Bella’s father, <a href=#>Charlie Swan</a>, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very introverted, somewhat taciturn, kind-hearted man. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the chief of&nbsp;police of&nbsp;the town of&nbsp;Forks and enjoys the peace and quiet of&nbsp;the community. Overall, the way this character was portrayed in&nbsp;the movie actually displays his personality pretty well. However, in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;physical appearance, there are 2&nbsp;main features that are different from the book. The first one is&nbsp;that in&nbsp;the book, there’s no&nbsp;mention of&nbsp;Charlie having a&nbsp;mustache, and the second is&nbsp;that his hair should be&nbsp;curly, and in&nbsp;the movies, it’s straight.</p><p><h2>6. Carlisle Cullen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c0/e19/3167075e62aec4af4a0d739dd1.jpg><p>Esme’s husband and <a href=#>father</a> of&nbsp;the Cullen family is&nbsp;a&nbsp;vampire who has made a&nbsp;firm commitment not to&nbsp;feed on&nbsp;human blood. As&nbsp;for his physical appearance, according to&nbsp;the book’s description, he&nbsp;looks as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;were 23&nbsp;years old, even though he&nbsp;isn’t, and he&nbsp;has blonde hair. Bella says that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;more handsome than any movie actor she had ever seen, yet he&nbsp;conveys a&nbsp;certain world-weary appearance. Actor Peter Facinelli managed to&nbsp;bring Carlisle to&nbsp;the big screen thanks to&nbsp;his great acting skills. However, it’s also true that he&nbsp;looks considerably older than he&nbsp;should, based on&nbsp;the book’s description. Also, there are no&nbsp;obvious signs of&nbsp;weariness in&nbsp;his look or&nbsp;his expressions.</p><p><h2>7. Esme Cullen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/032/5dd/be46755ed792fcbdbea818de54.jpg><p>The mother of&nbsp;the Cullen family, <a href=#>Esme</a>, like everyone else, is&nbsp;very beautiful and attractive, only, unlike her children and her husband, her face and body features are less sharp because her transformation occurred so&nbsp;soon after she gave birth. Bella describes her as&nbsp;slender but with a&nbsp;rounded figure, with beautiful caramel-colored hair, dimples, and a&nbsp;heart-shaped face. In&nbsp;the film, Esme does in&nbsp;fact have that sort of&nbsp;“calm beauty.” However, the face of&nbsp;the actress who plays that role has a&nbsp;more square-shaped face. Maybe that’s what takes away some of&nbsp;the “innocent silent film actress” vibes that Bella describes when talking about the first time she saw her.</p><p><h2>8. Alice Cullen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ef/7ef/dad6de517ebdbb50020416e3b3.jpg><p><a href=#>Alice</a>, the step-daughter of&nbsp;the Cullens and Edward’s sister, is&nbsp;known for having the ability to&nbsp;foresee the future. She has an&nbsp;outgoing, optimistic personality and loves Bella like a&nbsp;sister. In&nbsp;the books, she is&nbsp;described as&nbsp;petite and graceful, very beautiful, and has messy, black, pixie-cut hair. In&nbsp;the movies, if&nbsp;you recall, she actually is&nbsp;very similar to&nbsp;Bella’s description from the books. There’s just an&nbsp;important detail missing in&nbsp;the movies: the actress who plays the role of&nbsp;Alice has dark brown hair with reddish undertones, but it&nbsp;should actually be&nbsp;just plain black.</p><p><h2>9. Rosalie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfd/c27/611e0e5425830646946e546e36.jpg><p><a href=#>Rosalie</a> Hale, the stepdaughter to&nbsp;the Cullens and wife to&nbsp;Emmett, is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;look like an&nbsp;18-year-old, even though she’s not. Much like the rest of&nbsp;her foster family, she is&nbsp;exceptionally beautiful, tall, slender, and with wavy blonde hair. In&nbsp;the book, it’s also said that she has a&nbsp;very intimidating presence, maybe because of&nbsp;her extraordinary beauty. Actress Nikki Reed played the role of&nbsp;Rosalie in&nbsp;the movies. In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;physical traits, clearly, Reed and Rosalie are strikingly similar. However, Reed isn’t that intimidating.</p><p><h2>10. Jane</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/995/61c/b6d22c521da6dded5b2d5498b2.jpg><p>Jane, Alec’s sister, is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Volturi guard. She has a&nbsp;somewhat strange superpower: she’s able to&nbsp;create pain in&nbsp;the minds of&nbsp;others. She’s described as&nbsp;being petite with <a href=#>short brown hair</a>, thick lips, and has an&nbsp;almost angelic expression on&nbsp;her face. Jane is&nbsp;played by&nbsp;Dakota Fanning in&nbsp;the film adaptation, but when you think about&nbsp;it, her characterization is&nbsp;not very close to&nbsp;the book’s description since on&nbsp;the big screen, it’s pretty clear that Jane is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, and her haircut does not match the one from the book.</p><p><h2>11. Aro</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d57/2be/a6f3cf5d7992ba8b2eb3484596.jpg><p>Aro, Jane and Alec’s master, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the leaders of&nbsp;the Volturi clan and possesses the power of&nbsp;telepathy. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cheerful and warm-hearted vampire. You could even say that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;optimism. His transformation occurred in&nbsp;his early twenties, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;looks fairly young still. Michael Sheen, the actor who plays him, has a&nbsp;very similar appearance to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;his character, according to&nbsp;the book. However, the vampire’s eyes in&nbsp;the book are described as&nbsp;being of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>milky red</a> hue, which is&nbsp;not clearly seen in&nbsp;the movie, plus, he&nbsp;looks older than he&nbsp;should.</p><p>After reading this, can you think of&nbsp;any other characters from the saga that are different in&nbsp;the movies than in&nbsp;the books? Let&nbsp;us know in&nbsp;the comments. Maybe you had a&nbsp;different actor or&nbsp;actress in&nbsp;mind to&nbsp;play that character!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmq6GdXZi1or7AnKueqqNis7O7zGarsKGcnrSpwIywnKudXajCsbzOrJydZaSkeq27zqRkpaGbmnqir8KoqZ2hnpx6tbuMrZ%2BeZZKkvKy%2FjHFnampkZnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charlie-dimmock.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charlie-dimmock.html>Charlie Dimmock popularity &amp;amp; fame</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./agence-france-entrepreneurs-une-place-centrale-dans-la-transmission-dentreprise.html>une place centrale dans la transmission d'entreprise</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./agence-france-entrepreneurs-une-place-centrale-dans-la-transmission-dentreprise.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
