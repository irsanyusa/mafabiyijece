Faded buzz cut</h3><p class=align-left>Perhaps your son does not want to wear long hair? Do not worry – buzz cuts are a trend of this season, and they are even more fun if you add some interesting elements to them. For instance, you can shave one part as a letter V or half-moon, or shave off the sides in some interesting geometric fashion. Buzz cuts with fade are popular both among grown men and little boys because they are stylish, practical and pleasant to look at.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c7fa777b096661c1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60 cornrows hairstyle ideas for men and women to rock the day</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4180644a31786d29.png><h3>2. Short curly hair with interesting designs</h3><p class=align-left>The curls are a little longer than a buzz cut, but they are no less attractive and practical. They preserve the African spirit and would be perfect to wear for your little boy. Besides, they give a feeling of comfort and warmth. Surely, your son will not refuse this hairstyle, knowing that it will make him look cool and fashionable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c7fa777b096661c1.jpg><h3>3. High fade with a shaved-off line</h3><p class=align-left>The uniqueness of this hairstyle is that you can leave the amount of hair you wish on top of the head, but then you shave off a straight line under it and shave your hair underneath so it looks like it is fading. This hairstyle choice is pretty innovative and modern, and you can see more and more young boys in the streets rocking this hair. It would be a perfect pick if your boy’s curls are only starting to grow, and you leave them a little out of order.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73db687c82bbbb29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 simple braid styles with extensions to rock this season</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt44hjj5v2asd.jpg><h3>4. High fade with memorable designs</h3><p class=align-left>This hair might look like the previous picks, but the beauty of this hairstyle is that you can shave anything you want on the faded part of your hair – just choose the right design. It can be just abstract patterns, or the first letter of the boy’s name, or something related to things he likes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6csc6a3sq3u.jpg><h3>5. Frohawk with unique designs</h3><p class=align-left>In a way, this hairstyle can be compared to the former one. However, the difference is that your boy’s hair will be put together in a voluminous curly frohawk, which will totally attract everyone’s attention. To make the hairstyle even more appealing, the fade can be decorated with the gorgeous designs. There is no doubt that your son will become a trendsetter among his peers, and all the friends and classmates will desire to have the similar hairstyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73db687c82bbbb29.jpg><h3>6. Medium curls</h3><p class=align-left>It is a well-known fact that the boys who have curly hair give a positive vibe – people are convinced that they have a good heart, are kind and friendly. But at the same time, curls give some additional confidence and independence, which is much needed for your little man when he is trying to gain popularity among other children. So, you can let his natural hair loose and shave only the sides – it will frame his face shape nicely, and it is also very practical when it comes to hair care.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5d742ac62f785c2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Make a statement with these 15 lovely short natural hairstyles</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3c988j3pupu.jpg><h3>7.

Fishbone cornrow styles</h3><p class=align-left>Fishbone cornrows are really perfect pick for a bold girl who likes fun. Your daughter is guaranteed to set trends with the unique fishbone designs on her head. If there is some hair left, you can put it into a ponytail, style it in a separate way, or just leave it be. Another benefit of fishbone hairstyle is that it does not need special care – just refreshing your curls every day with the help of good hair oil would be enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytphqt7ndsi0o.jpg><h3>3. Twisted braids</h3><p class=align-left>This hair option is one of the girl classics, and you can do basically any other hairstyle out of them – which includes, braids, buns, and ponytails. If your girl is wearing the twists, you will not have to constantly worry about styling them – they literally just style themselves. This option can also be perfect for those girls who have naturally dry hair – twists are very protective and useful for them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bc00m5e1sa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 trendy natural hairstyles for short hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7253b06bbdd84a0a_w.jpg><h3>4. “Shirley Temple” curly hair</h3><p class=align-left>Young girls love this hairstyle so much for a reason – it makes every young lady look sweet, fresh, and adorable. This hair option may be considered a retro one, but it is still popular among Nigerian girls and their mothers who happily style their daughters’ hair. To create these beautiful curls on your head, you will need to create flat twists in front, and then the curly spirals in the back of your head. This hairstyle offers plenty of various options – the pigtails, ponytail, or letting your hair loose. A good recommendation from the hair experts is wearing a protective satin bonnet on the head when you sleep because comparing to braids, the twists are not so tight, so you should look out not to mess them up.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Crochet hair styles for kids in 2018</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7emfq6rubt6.jpg><h3>5.

Side ponytail</h3><p class=align-left>This playful ponytail will make every girl feel like a celebrity. Your girl can wear it to a birthday party or some important event in her life.
