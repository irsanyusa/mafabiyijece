The victim, in this case, is 15 years old</p><p>‘They, the couple, were interviewed at the police station. Both of the defendants have provided a prepared statement.</p><p>‘Mr Ekweremadu in his prepared statement denied allegations of human trafficking.</p><p>‘He said at no stage has he arranged transport for anyone with the intention to exploit them.’</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Gavin Irwin</strong>, representing Ekweremadu, said: ‘There is no question this is a serious allegation. Mr Ekweremadu is a member of the senate in Nigeria.</p><p>‘He has previously held an even more senior role as deputy president of the senate.</p><p>‘He is a member of the bar in Nigeria. He is a principal in a law firm that bears his name.</p><p>‘Those issues taken together go way beyond him being a person of good character…rather that he has led a blameless life as a public servant.’</p><p><strong>Antonia Gray</strong>, the defence counsel for Mrs Ekweremadu, said her client has an unblemished record and has never been involved in illegal trafficking of any young person.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>‘She has never been complicit or involved in any alleged illegal trafficking of any young person.</p><p>‘She is a financial accountant…with an unblemished record,’ Gray said.</p><p>After the counsel for both sides had presented their argument, Magistrate Lois Sheard said: ‘These are serious allegations and these matters are now adjourned until 7 July back here at Uxbridge.’</p><p>Ms Sheard, therefore, remanded both defendants in custody ahead of their hearing next month.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-34>Ekweremadu, wife risk long jail term if convicted</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Since the former Deputy Senate President and his wife are accused of conspiracy to harvest an organ of a minor, the couple may face life imprisonment if found guilty and convicted to maximum sentence under the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Act 2015.</p><p>According to the Act, “A person guilty of an offence under Section 1 or 2 is liable (a)on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life; (b)on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or a fine or both.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXywvsaapWagkafDpr%2FToqWgZZWgxKa%2BxKaYna2jYq6zvsSsq2ahnmLCrHnWoZitZaeaeqy6zrBkrKddm66ze9anqbCxnZ0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2forgan-harvesting-ekweremadus-arrest-in-uk-what-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2forgan-harvesting-ekweremadus-arrest-in-uk-what-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2forgan-harvesting-ekweremadus-arrest-in-uk-what-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2forgan-harvesting-ekweremadus-arrest-in-uk-what-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2forgan-harvesting-ekweremadus-arrest-in-uk-what-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2forgan-harvesting-ekweremadus-arrest-in-uk-what-we-know-so-far.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./coming-soon-on-dvd-rukky-sanda-set-to-release-gold-digging-on-dvd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./coming-soon-on-dvd-rukky-sanda-set-to-release-gold-digging-on-dvd.html>Rukky Sanda Set to Release 'Gold Digging' on DVD</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lutilisation-des-drones-par-les-polices-municipales-de-nouveau-retoquee.html>Lutilisation des drones par les polices municipales de nouveau retoque</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lutilisation-des-drones-par-les-polices-municipales-de-nouveau-retoquee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
