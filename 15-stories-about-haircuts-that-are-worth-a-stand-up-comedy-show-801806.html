Once she went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;salon and explained to&nbsp;the stylist what haircut she wanted. She even showed a&nbsp;photo on&nbsp;her smartphone. The stylist listened to&nbsp;her for a&nbsp;long time and didn’t interrupt. When my&nbsp;friend finished her explanation, the stylist said, “Remember, miss, you can ask for any haircut, but the stylist will do&nbsp;whatever they want!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>PolAnd1962&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li><li>A&nbsp;woman in&nbsp;the ladies’ hairdressing program was learning how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;highlights on&nbsp;a&nbsp;client, a&nbsp;teenage girl with long straight black Asian hair. The client showed a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;some very subtle highlights for reference. She was very excited about the whole process, and the great deal she got by&nbsp;going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;school. When they removed the foils, her hair was banana yellow. In&nbsp;thick, chunky streaks. To&nbsp;say she was upset was an&nbsp;understatement. She was almost screaming. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anaugustleaf&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;have this story from a&nbsp;hair salon. The stylist asked&nbsp;me, “Who cut you like this? Everything’s askew. Terrible!” I&nbsp;didn’t hesitate to&nbsp;say that&nbsp;I had gotten my&nbsp;haircut in&nbsp;this salon. The stylist was silent until the end of&nbsp;the cut. And the salon, by&nbsp;the way, wasn’t cheap. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ya_vam_pishu&nbsp;/ AdMe</a></li></ul><p><h2>“My&nbsp;nephew got a&nbsp;really bad haircut this week.

Once, I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular barbershop across the street. They gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;great haircut and it&nbsp;was pretty cheap. I&nbsp;began to&nbsp;visit them once a&nbsp;month. One day, a&nbsp;sales assistant at&nbsp;our grocery store asked why&nbsp;I hadn’t gone to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;haircut. I&nbsp;got confused and asked, “Why? Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;time?” She replied, “Irene has been waiting for you for a&nbsp;week.” I&nbsp;didn’t even know that the same stylist had cut my&nbsp;hair, that her name was Irene, or&nbsp;that she was waiting for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Nick903&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li><li>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the same stylist at&nbsp;one hair salon. I&nbsp;really liked her: she cut my&nbsp;hair nicely, understood&nbsp;me, and the best thing, we&nbsp;always had a&nbsp;great conversation. Once I&nbsp;was sitting in&nbsp;the salon, and we&nbsp;were discussing Pedro Almodóvar’s <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>, talking about historic books we&nbsp;had read on&nbsp;the topic, and then we&nbsp;switched our talk to&nbsp;documentaries. Suddenly a&nbsp;client sat down with the stylist next to&nbsp;us. This guy was complaining about how he&nbsp;didn’t like the way his bangs were and how he&nbsp;couldn’t style them, for 10&nbsp;minutes. The stylist began to&nbsp;comfort him. My&nbsp;stylist and&nbsp;I fell silent at&nbsp;the same time. It&nbsp;was good that she was finishing. I&nbsp;couldn’t stand this whining about the bangs anymore.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Delo v&nbsp;shlyape&nbsp;/ AdMe</a></li><li>I&nbsp;was sitting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;barbershop when a&nbsp;guy in&nbsp;his twenties came in&nbsp;and sat in&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair. To&nbsp;the barber’s question, “What haircut would you like?” he&nbsp;replied, “I&nbsp;want the trendiest haircut among guys who are 18&nbsp;to&nbsp;27&nbsp;years old.” She turned him away from the mirror in&nbsp;silence, took a&nbsp;trimmer, and trimmed it&nbsp;all off. This is&nbsp;what&nbsp;I call “without further ado.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Podslushano&nbsp;/ Ideer</a></li></ul><p><h2>“I&nbsp;asked for a&nbsp;red to&nbsp;copper balayage/ombre and paid $450 for this.

A&nbsp;woman walked in&nbsp;and asked how much it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;apply dye to&nbsp;the roots of&nbsp;her hair, put a&nbsp;plastic bag&nbsp;on, and let her go&nbsp;home. I&nbsp;told her that&nbsp;I wouldn’t let her go&nbsp;with a&nbsp;bag on&nbsp;her head. She had brought her own dye, and&nbsp;I said that&nbsp;I couldn’t be&nbsp;responsible for the result. Eventually, when&nbsp;I washed off the dye, the client was in&nbsp;shock, because her hair had turned red. She asked if&nbsp;I could change the color. I&nbsp;replied that she would have to&nbsp;pay twice. The following 90&nbsp;minutes passed in&nbsp;complete silence.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;AtatoraMatushka&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li><li>Once I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;salon to&nbsp;get my&nbsp;hair dyed. I&nbsp;had been there 5&nbsp;times, and everything had always turned out fine. But this was not my&nbsp;day. First, when they washed off the dye, the hot water was switched off, so&nbsp;they had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;with icy cold water. Then it&nbsp;turned out that the stylist didn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;right, so&nbsp;the color on&nbsp;the roots was terrible. When the stylist was blow-drying my&nbsp;hair, I&nbsp;was crying, and then a&nbsp;lock of&nbsp;my&nbsp;hair got stuck in&nbsp;the dryer, and it&nbsp;was pulled out. It&nbsp;was awful! But the main thing is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wasn’t even thinking about not paying for&nbsp;it. Now, when&nbsp;I look back at&nbsp;that situation, I&nbsp;understand that the salon should have paid me&nbsp;for all this suffering.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Maria Lakomkina&nbsp;/ Facebook</a></li><li>Do&nbsp;you know that feeling when you’re sitting in&nbsp;the stylist’s chair, your hair has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;clips in&nbsp;it, and you’re looking in&nbsp;the mirror and thinking about whether you’ve always been that ugly. Seriously, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;other place except for the hair salon chair that can make you feel uglier.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;HeIIoSidney96&nbsp;/ Twitter</a></li></ul><p><h2>“The force was not with my&nbsp;hairdresser yesterday.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c8/af6/7388bc5c7e8857795107f6217f.jpg><ul><li>My&nbsp;friend, who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hairdresser, told me&nbsp;this.

Recently I&nbsp;couldn’t sleep properly. Today I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;beauty salon, sat in&nbsp;the hair stylist’s chair, and fell asleep for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes, right with the blow-dryer buzzing over my&nbsp;ear. I&nbsp;woke&nbsp;up, startled, asking, “What year is&nbsp;it?” I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;reconsider my&nbsp;daily routine.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Podslushano&nbsp;/ Ideer</a></li></ul><p><h2>“I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;new barber.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b4/49f/35c9b055398119673827d98307.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;dye my&nbsp;hair, and my&nbsp;friend recommended the best hair colorist in&nbsp;town who she herself admired. I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;that colorist’s photos on&nbsp;Instagram and texted her. Her prices were 3&nbsp;times higher than in&nbsp;any luxurious salon. I&nbsp;thought, “OK, she’s the best.” I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;discuss my&nbsp;future haircut, but the lady said that an&nbsp;“even cut” was her signature style. But I&nbsp;can’t have that because of&nbsp;my&nbsp;hair structure. I&nbsp;refused politely and asked whether she could just dye my&nbsp;hair. No&nbsp;way. It&nbsp;turned out that she thought of&nbsp;herself as&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist, and&nbsp;I was not allowed to&nbsp;spoil her masterpiece with some low-grade haircut. I&nbsp;was stunned. I&nbsp;politely declined and went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;favorite stylist after a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days. Now I’m sporting my&nbsp;“low-grade” haircut, which was done the way&nbsp;I wanted&nbsp;it, not the way the “artist” wanted it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Juliapo&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li><li>I&nbsp;love when you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;salon for a&nbsp;hair treatment, which means that&nbsp;I know that it’s dry and porous, but the hairdresser starts preaching, “Oh, your hair looks so&nbsp;dull, you have to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;it...” Tactlessness, level 7,000. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;KDukalis&nbsp;/ Twitter</a></li><li>My&nbsp;father-in-law is&nbsp;over&nbsp;50, and a&nbsp;simple working man. He&nbsp;usually visits cheap barber shops where they cut hair without washing&nbsp;it. Once he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;better barbershop. The barber told him that they needed to&nbsp;wash his hair, and he&nbsp;had never done that before in&nbsp;a&nbsp;barbershop. So, he&nbsp;went up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the sink, stood up&nbsp;on&nbsp;his knees on&nbsp;the chair, and put his head under the tap, like he&nbsp;did at&nbsp;home. When the barber saw that, she became indignant, “Are you kidding&nbsp;me?” But when&nbsp;I imagine this scene (a&nbsp;grown-up man with his head in&nbsp;the sink and his butt up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the air), I&nbsp;can’t stop laughing.
