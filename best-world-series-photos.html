I shot this picture via radio remote after I had placed and set the camera at the top of the stadium. I was on the field and fired it from there while shooting the action with my hand held camera at the end of the game. It was an angle that nobody else got that night and I was happy to successfully shoot something different to so many photographers from all over the country who were there covering the same event.

I remember this one well because it was in Detroit and I hadn’t done a World Series there ever. The San Francisco Giants were up 3-0 going into Game 4 on a Sunday night and everyone from Sports Illustrated was pulling for the Giants to wrap up. A Giants victory would allow SI to put out their current issue with a World Series cover that would only be a few days old when it hit the street and in subscribers’ mailboxes. If the World Series went back to San Francisco for a Game 5, we would be too late for the current issue. I was working with my colleagues Al Tielemans and Chuck Solomon. The way we normally worked the games is that we rotated through positions. So my assigned positions for Game 4 was going to be in Center Field looking in toward the field and the dugouts. It’s kind of a safety position because you can pretty much see everything from that spot. Except that someone at SI thought we should try to shoot from a spot in Left Field. I made a stink about being in Center Field because it put more pressure on everyone else if the position in Left Field was one that could be obstructed by fans. So<span class=marker></span> much happens on the mound I just thought it was imperative to be there in a possible clinching game. Nate Gordon, our baseball picture editor saw my point and agreed to have me go to Center Field as we had agreed earlier in our plans. I have to admit that I had a plan about the Center Field position. From the way I was tracking the games I thought there was a strong possibility Buster Posey would win the MVP of the series and I knew he would head straight toward the mound if San Francisco won. I was banking on that photo if they won. As it turned out that is exactly what happened and to make it even sweeter Detroit Tigers superstar Miguel Cabrera was the hitter who struck out to end the game. You can see him in the cover photo walking away from the batter’s box after striking out.”</p><p style=text-align:center;margin-top:50px;margin-bottom:10px><span style="font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,Helvetica,Arial sans-serif;color:#000;font-size:18px;letter-spacing:.18em;line-height:80%;font-weight:400;text-transform:uppercase;-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased;margin:10px 0;text-decoration:none">2014 – San Francisco Giants v.

Madison came back to throw a complete game shutout in game six, the first since 2003. He gave up only four hits while striking out eight and not issuing one walk. The Royals thought that would be the last they would see of Madison during the series. Rarely do starting pitchers throw on less than three days rest but a tight game seven called for drastic measures–Giants manager Bruce Bochy did the unthinkable. He called on his ace to come on in relief with only two days rest…in the fifth inning! Madison blanked the Royals over the final five frames setting down 14 in a row at one point. It was an unbelievable feat. Just incredible.
