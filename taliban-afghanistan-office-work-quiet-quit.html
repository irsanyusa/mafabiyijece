They find ‘clocking in’ for office work tedious and almost unbearable, although some said they were now getting used to the routine,” the report states.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We couldn’t destroy the Taliban, but office work destroyed the Taliban,” <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> one Tiktoker, reviewing <a href=# rel=noopener>articles</a> and quotes from the <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a>. Here are the various reasons the interviewees are fed up with a 9-to-5:</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Mundane office culture</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The former fighters found themselves missing the freedom of the front-lines as they adjusted to the mundane nature of office work. Huzaifa, a 24 year-old former sniper, said, “The Taliban used to be free of restrictions, but now we sit in one place, behind a desk and a computer 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Life’s become so wearisome; you do the same things every day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In our ministry, there’s little work for me to do,” said Abdul Nafi, 25. “Therefore, I spend most of my time on Twitter. We’re connected to speedy Wi-Fi and Internet. Many mujahedin, including me, are addicted to the Internet, especially Twitter.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And with a 9-to-5 comes the dreaded commute—and actually having to show up for the job in order to get paid. “What I don’t like about Kabul is its ever-increasing traffic holdups.” Omar Mansur, 32, said. ”These days, you have to go to the office before 8 AM and stay there till 4 PM. If you don’t go, you’re considered absent, and [the wage for] that day is cut from your salary. We’re now used to that, but it was especially difficult in the first two or three months.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Added responsibilities</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taliban-quiet-quitting-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Government work has come with pressures and responsibilities the men did not prepare for– or particularly want. “In the time of jihad, life was very simple. All we had to deal with was making plans for ta’aruz [attacks] against the enemy and for retreating,” said Huzaifa. “People didn’t expect much from us, and we had little responsibility towards them, whereas now if someone is hungry, he deems us directly responsible for that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Abdul Salam, 26, says, “Whatever happens in Afghanistan, people blame us. Even a minor misdeed by us makes it to the media that the Taleban are doing this and that. It’s like the cameras of the entire world are watching us.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Lack of social lives</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Work has heavily cut into their social lives too. “Those in Kabul, like me, work from 8 AM to 4 PM. So, most of the week, we don’t get any time to meet each other” said Mansur.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The camaraderie amongst fighters has dwindled, the jihadists say, as previously non-existent hierarchies are now far more apparent, and many around them get swept up in the pursuit of money. “I sometimes miss the jihad life for all the good things it had,” said Nafi. “During jihad, you couldn’t have known the difference between a commander and a foot soldier like me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kamran, a 27 year-old deputy group commander, longs for the simple life. “Now, when someone’s nominated for a government job, he first asks whether that position has a car or not. We used to live among the people. Many of us have now caged ourselves in our offices and palaces.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Low pay, high cost of living</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the insurgency, Samim notes that the men did not need to earn money to support their families, as the movement covered their expenses. “The jihad, a religious duty which exempted them from such everyday concerns, is over: they now have to work for the survival of their families like everyone else.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The high cost of rent and his relative low pay have been a barrier for Mansur, who is not earning enough money to move his family to the city. Salam echoed the high cost of living in Kabul, and said that he missed the freedom of the jihad, with little supervision and a clear purpose.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There is a proverb in our area that money is like a shackle,” says Salam. “Now, if we complain, or don’t come to work, or disobey the rules, they cut our salary.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamZohnGCjq2YpaGSlrturcWgn5qmmajBorqMqJ2foZOaeri70aRkqq2ZmsFuvdSiq2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1152522-top-10-hustle-quotes-by-rappers-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1152522-top-10-hustle-quotes-by-rappers-html.html>Top 10 hustle quotes by rappers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1489260-risevest-ceo-steps-sexual-misconduct-allegations.html>RiseVest CEO Steps Down Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1489260-risevest-ceo-steps-sexual-misconduct-allegations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
