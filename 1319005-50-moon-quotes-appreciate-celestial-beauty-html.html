However, if you read a bunch of moon quotes, you will definitely want to dedicate some time to stargazing.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f4daa8010ab811b4.jpg><p class=align-left>For generations, starry nights have inspired people all over the world. Fascination with the unparalleled beauty of celestial bodies has resulted in zillions of quotes about the moon, stars, and sun.</p><h2>The most beautiful moon quotes</h2><p class=align-left>For centuries, people across the world have been looking up at the night sky. For many of them, celestial bodies are a source of inspiration and an object of admiration.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, today, we have many marvellous stars and full moon quotes that remind us about their unique and mysterious beauty. Each quote from the list below is a gem that we should treasure.</p><ul><li>When hope is fleeting, stop for a moment and visualize, in the sky of silver, the crescent of a lavender moon. Imagine it - delicate, slim, precise, like a paper-thin slice from a cabochon jewel. It may not be very useful, but it is beautiful. And sometimes it is enough. - Vera Nazarian</li><li>Silene, who declines the garish noontide’s blazing light; but when the evening crescent shines, gives all her sweetness to the night. - Charlotte Turner Smith</li><li>What intelligent being, what being capable of responding emotionally to a beautiful sight, can look at the jagged, silvery lunar crescent trembling in the azure sky, even through the weakest of telescopes, and not be struck by it in an intensely pleasurable way, not feel cut off from everyday life here on Earth and transported toward that first step on celestial journeys? - Camille Flammarion</li><li>Every phase of our life belongs to us. The moon does not, except in appearance, lose her first thin, luminous curve, nor her silvery crescent, in rounding to her full. The woman is still both child and girl, in the completeness of womanly character. - Lucy Larcom</li><li>Winter crescent resting in the high pine bough - you fly through the woods like a lone snow bird. - John Geddes</li><li>When I look over my past, I see that the stages in my life are like the phases of the moon. I've had periods where I was the waxing gibbous: fat with wealth and success. There have been other seasons when my happiness was like the waning crescent and I watched my joy fade away slowly, merging with the atmosphere around me as if it never existed. Then I felt as if I was left with nothing more than an illusion, but happiness returns in time and glows once more in corpulent fullness. It's time that makes the difference. - Amy Neftzger</li><li>The moon is a loyal companion. It never leaves. It’s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human. Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections. - Tahereh Mafi</li><li>The moon does not fight. It attacks no one. It does not worry. It does not try to crush others. It keeps to its course, but by its very nature, it gently influences. What other body could pull an entire ocean from shore to shore? The moon is faithful to its nature and its power is never diminished. - Deng Ming-Dao</li><li>Tell me what you feel in your room when the full moon is shining in upon you and your lamp is dying out, and I will tell you how old you are, and I shall know if you are happy. - Henri Frederic Amiel</li><li>The moon will guide you through the night with her brightness, but she will always dwell in the darkness, in order to be seen. - Shannon L. Alder</li><li>I’ve never seen a moon in the sky that, if it didn’t take my breath away, at least misplaced it for a moment. - Colin Farrell</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/489ae39a00aed816.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How would you rock this?

Therefore, sending moon quotes about love to your partner is a perfect way to remind him or her about your feelings.</p><p class=align-left>Sweet lines about night skies will make any heart beat faster. Below are the best romantic moon quotes that will convey your love to your sweetheart.</p><ul><li>The sun loves the moon so much that he dies every night to let her breathe, and in return, she reflects his love. - Jeffrey Fry</li><li>I ignored your aura but it grabbed me by the hand like the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the sand. - Talib Kwell</li><li>Two things I'll forever be sure of, the sun will always fall for the moon and I will always fall for you. - R. M. Broderick</li><li>I’m often difficult to love. I go through dark periods like the moon and I hide from myself. But I promise I will kiss your wounds when they’re hurting. Even if they’re in your soul, I can find them with the light in my fingertips. I will lead you to the river so you can remember how beautiful it feels to be moved by something that is out of your control. And when our dark periods match, we can breathe with the grass and look at the night sky. The stars will remind us of the beauty in our struggles and we won’t feel lost anymore. - Emery Allen</li><li>If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression of something beautiful, but annihilating. - Sylvia Plath</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/02d52a8881e20744.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fashion for older people: 9 times Joke Silva served major style goals in stylish ensembles</span></p></a><h2>Reach for the moon quotes that will inspire you</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/87c4737a6424f5fb.jpg><p class=align-left>Space and anything related to it has always piqued interest in people of various backgrounds.
