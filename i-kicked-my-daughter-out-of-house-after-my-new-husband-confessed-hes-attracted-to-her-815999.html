<time>15 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A&nbsp;complex family story that a&nbsp;Reddit user shared has garnered many absolutely different reactions. A&nbsp;woman appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough situation where she had to&nbsp;choose between her husband and her daughter. All users had a&nbsp;different take on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother’s choice and the story she told. Keep reading to&nbsp;see what had people so&nbsp;riled&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;woman took to&nbsp;the social network in&nbsp;an&nbsp;absolutely desperate state.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3d/dad/1b701d590c8db139c0d1cd457d.jpg><p>A&nbsp;55-year-old woman took to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a> with a&nbsp;story that shocked many people. The mom revealed she had married her current husband for 4&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;also appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the stepfather of&nbsp;her daughter.</p><p>Her daughter is&nbsp;a&nbsp;23-year-old young woman. She was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. The reason for it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=# title=trauma data-link=tag>trauma</a> from watching the woman’s and her previous partner’s horrible <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> go&nbsp;<a href=# title=down data-link=tag>down</a>. Because of&nbsp;this, the woman’s daughter also had a&nbsp;very complex relationship with peers at&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a>. When she told her mom peers were teasing her, the mom’s view that all children are innocent really tied her hands. She told her daughter that if&nbsp;she said anything to&nbsp;them, she would appear as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult harassing a&nbsp;child.</p><p><h2>The woman’s relationship with her daughter had already been complicated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/b54/04163252a9b3a7913702f74108.jpg><p>The woman’s daughter has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blamed</a> her for everything in&nbsp;their family. The girl wasn’t taking care of&nbsp;her hygiene due to&nbsp;depression, and the relationship at&nbsp;school became even worse. Part of&nbsp;the mom’s response was telling her to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;shower, and she bought her new clothes.</p><p>The mom thought that having her daughter live with her while she finished school and got a&nbsp;job would help heal some childhood wounds if&nbsp;her second husband and the mom herself modeled a&nbsp;healthy relationship. However, her daughter now doesn’t get along with her husband. She is&nbsp;very introverted and creative and likes immersing herself in&nbsp;escapism. So&nbsp;she’d get annoyed if&nbsp;she was eating alone, and her stepdad would sit across from her and eat. Saying she ate later so&nbsp;she could eat alone.</p><p><h2>One day, the family faced a&nbsp;situation like thunder in&nbsp;the blue sky.</h2></p><p>However, the woman’s husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> acting distant from her, and her daughter complained that his eyes lingered for too long. She got furious, and there was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;shouting and door-slamming. Then, the woman writes, “<strong>Finally, my&nbsp;husband admitted he’s attracted to&nbsp;her, and it’s hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around her all day. She said she was walking temptation, and that’s why he&nbsp;was avoiding any relationship with&nbsp;me.”</strong></p><p>The woman was so&nbsp;upset to&nbsp;hear this. She says, “I&nbsp;don’t blame my&nbsp;daughter for this, but the situation has become unbearable at&nbsp;the same time. Something would have to&nbsp;give, and&nbsp;I couldn’t collect my&nbsp;thoughts with both of&nbsp;them still being in&nbsp;the house.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd1/35f/e687f35001b526afaffc57564b.jpg><p>So, the woman made a&nbsp;hard decision. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave</a> her daughter money to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;an&nbsp;extended-stay hotel and asked her to&nbsp;utilize her college’s emergency financial and housing resources for students in&nbsp;need.</p><p>The mom insists she’s not abandoning her daughter. She just needs time to&nbsp;process the situation and doesn’t want to&nbsp;leave her house to&nbsp;stay with her daughter when she has a&nbsp;marriage to&nbsp;figure out whether or&nbsp;not to&nbsp;save.</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story about <a href=#>mom and daughter</a>, who aren’t quarreling because of&nbsp;men but go&nbsp;on&nbsp;double dates together instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZut8icop6cXaLGbrDArp6hrJWnerDB02amn2WYpMK0sYyana2domK6unnNnq5moKWor6K6w2aaqKaWmsC0scNmn56rXZbBtb7AnKuenF2pvG60xKtkcWllboZ6ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-kicked-my-daughter-out-of-house-after-my-new-husband-confessed-hes-attracted-to-her-815999.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-kicked-my-daughter-out-of-house-after-my-new-husband-confessed-hes-attracted-to-her-815999.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-kicked-my-daughter-out-of-house-after-my-new-husband-confessed-hes-attracted-to-her-815999.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-kicked-my-daughter-out-of-house-after-my-new-husband-confessed-hes-attracted-to-her-815999.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-kicked-my-daughter-out-of-house-after-my-new-husband-confessed-hes-attracted-to-her-815999.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-kicked-my-daughter-out-of-house-after-my-new-husband-confessed-hes-attracted-to-her-815999.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./contrats-de-plan-etat-region-2014-2020-pour-un-volet-mobilite-robuste-et-strategique.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./contrats-de-plan-etat-region-2014-2020-pour-un-volet-mobilite-robuste-et-strategique.html>pour un volet mobilit robuste et stratgique</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1585391-breaking-nigeria-beat-mali-morocco.html>Mali Defeats Super Eagles of Nigeria in Marrakech, Morocco</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1585391-breaking-nigeria-beat-mali-morocco.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
