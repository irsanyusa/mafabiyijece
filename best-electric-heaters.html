Electric heaters are a great way to provide supplemental heat in your home or office, packing a lot of punch for something that is both portable and quick to turn on or off. These heaters can be moved around the house as needed since they can be plugged into any outlet (no heater on this list surpasses 1500W). Their smaller size and directed airflow make electric heaters a cost-effective and fast option for heating a single room within a larger building without increasing the building’s central heat.</p><p>While every model on this list is efficient at heating, there are different products that may be better suited to different scenarios. Oscillating fans tend to be more effective at circulating air and heat around a room, while smart devices may be ideal for busy families or young professionals on the go. Some electric heaters can be wall-mounted, while others are particularly small and lightweight for greater portability. For those on a budget, I’ve included some very effective yet affordably priced options. At the same time, those willing to spend more may get a more chic design or added functionality, such as air purification.</p><p>Whatever your needs, there is an electric space heater for you on this list. Read on to find out which is the best electric heater for your home.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-an-electric-heater>What to consider when choosing an electric heater</h2><h3>Heat output and temperature settings</h3><p>While all electric heaters are built to make a space warmer, some are more powerful than others. Depending on the design of the heater, it may circulate air and heat across greater distances or at faster speeds than other models. However, greater power isn’t always better; if you’re heating a smaller space or need less supplemental heat, then an electric heater with lower power or one with varying temperature control settings will be just as effective and more energy-efficient. Colder regions or houses with larger rooms will benefit from more powerful heating units.</p><p>If you live in a climate with varying extremes or with people who like different temperature settings, then it may be worth buying an electric heater with several temperature settings so that you can customize the power level to the situation.</p><h3>Safety features</h3><p>Electric heaters are safe for casual home use, but many products offer additional safety features for extra peace of mind. If you live with small children or pets, this will likely be of even greater importance to you, so assess each heater for the extra precautions it provides. Many heaters offer automatic shut-offs, whether due to overheating or tipping over. A few feature covers that stay cool to the touch should a small hand or furred paw come into contact with the heater. Others offer the ability to turn off during the night, so there’s no risk of overheating while you’re asleep.</p><h3>Size and portability</h3><p>Perhaps there’s one room in your home that you spend the most time in but gets a bit cold. In that case, you probably care less about portability as the heater will stay put in one place. If you want a model that you can take around the house, to the garage, or to your office, then it will be more important to find a lightweight design that is practical to carry, perhaps with handles or wheels.</p><p>While larger heaters can be more powerful than their smaller counterparts, this isn’t always the case, so consider the average area heated by the unit, as well as its dimensions. Some heaters are also designed to be tall and pillar-shaped or wide and flat to better fit into tight spaces; think about where you will most likely use the heater and make sure it will fit comfortably there.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-electric-heaters>Our top picks for the best electric heaters</h2><h3>Best affordable electric heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lasko Ceramic Portable Space Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable electric heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Lasko 754201 Small Portable 1500W Electric Ceramic Space Heater with Tip-Over Safety Switch, Overheat Protection, Thermostat and Extra Long 8-ft Cord for Indoor Ho, 9.2 x 7 x 6 inches, Gray</h3></p><p>For effective heating at a low price point, you can’t do better than the Lasko Ceramic Portable Space Heater. Despite its diminutive size, it’s able to heat a space up to 100 square feet as quickly as larger models. Lasko includes two power levels and a fan setting in this heater, as well as built-in safety features that include automatic overheating protection and a tip-over safety switch. The heater doesn’t oscillate, so whatever is directly in front of the unit warms up more efficiently than the rest of the room, but this should pose no problem for smaller bedrooms or offices. Its low weight also makes it easy to transport to different locations as needed. While it’s not as flashy or powerful as some other products on this list, the Lasko Ceramic Heater is great value for its low price of around $30.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 9.2 inches high x 7 inches wide x 6 inches deep</li><li>Weight: 2.9 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 900W, 1500W</li><li>Material: Ceramic</li><li>Area Heated: 100 square feet</li><li>Price (at publish): $32.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Incredibly low price for a ceramic heater</li><li>Offers additional safety features such as a tip-over switch, plus three power settings</li><li>Small and lightweight, so easily portable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t oscillate, so heat is slower to spread throughout a room</li><li>Heats up to 100 square feet, which is on the lower end of this list</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For fast warmth, easy portability, and a great price, the Lasko Ceramic Portable Space Heater is a no brainer.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lasko Ceramic Portable Space Heater</a></p><h3>Best electric heater for small rooms: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Pelonis Tower Space Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best electric heater for small rooms</span></p><p><h3 class=title>PELONIS PTH15A4BGB Ceramic Tower 1500W Indoor Space Heater with Oscillation Remote Control Programmable Thermostat & 8H Timer ECO Mode Tip-Over Switch & Overheating Protection.Grey 23inch Grey</h3></p><p>The Pelonis Tower Space Heater combines the height and oscillating ability of a larger heater with the compact footprint of a much smaller one. At nearly 23 inches tall and with 70 degrees of oscillation, this electric heater is able to emit a lot of heat and circulate it around the room. Although the company states that this is limited to areas up to 160 square feet, reviewers consistently praise it for working in larger settings.</p><p>The Pelonis heater includes both a touch control and remote control, a cool-touch flame-resistant coating, and safety features like automatic tip-over shut off. For anyone who plans to get extensive use out of this heater, there is an eco-friendly power setting and an eight-hour timer to “set it and forget it.” While its height makes it more noticeable than other heaters, the slim shape is quite stylish, and it can easily nestle into a corner for a less obvious look.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 22.95 inches high x 7.17 inches wide x 7.17 inches deep</li><li>Weight: 6.27 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 1500W</li><li>Material: Ceramic</li><li>Area Heated: 160 square feet</li><li>Price (at publish): $59.98</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The height and 70 degrees of oscillation ensure efficient heat circulation</li><li>Very affordable price, especially considering the additional power and safety features</li><li>Eco-mode for energy efficiency, plus a low and high power setting</li><li>Multiple safety features and an 8-hour timer for greater peace of mind</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Larger, more noticeable silhouette</li><li>Company recommends for use in up to 160 square feet only</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Pelonis Tower Space Heater works very efficiently thanks to its height and oscillation while packing in a number of extra safety and energy settings.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Pelonis Tower Space Heater</a></p><h3>Best electric heater for large rooms: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vornado VH200 Space Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best electric heater for large rooms</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Vornado VH200 1500-Watt Electric Portable Space Heater, Whole Room Vortex Heat Circulation, Charcoal, Charcoal / Black</h3></p><p>The Vornado VH200 is so much more powerful than it looks. While it weighs barely four pounds and reaches just over ten inches in height, this electric heater can comfortably warm rooms up to 250 square feet in size. Not only that, but it does so almost silently, so you can be confident of there being minimal disruption whenever you have it on.</p><p>The Vornado VH200 features three different power settings (low, medium, and high) for greater versatility and includes a tip-over switch and automatic shutdown mechanism. In addition to being lightweight, there’s a carry handle on top for easy portability and a cool-touch case, so there’s no risk of burning your hands. You can get all this power for only $60, just don’t expect it to be the most stylish or modern-looking heater around. However, you can choose between three colors: Black, champagne, and charcoal.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 10.6 inches high x 10.4 inches wide x 9.2 inches deep</li><li>Weight: 4.06 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 750W, 1125W, 1500W</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Area Heated: 250 square feet</li><li>Price (at publish): $59.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Incredibly powerful for the size and price, heating areas up to 250 square feet in size</li><li>Includes a third, medium power setting for greater versatility, plus classic safety features</li><li>Almost silent when on, for minimal disruption</li><li>Lightweight and portable, with a carry handle</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The plastic material and look are not particularly stylish</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Vornado VH200 is the go-to pick for anyone who wants to heat up a larger space and do so quickly, quietly, and inexpensively.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vornado VH200 Space Heater</a></p><h3>Most stylish electric heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vornado VHEAT Vintage Metal Heater</a></h3><p>Unlike the VH200, Vornado’s VHEAT Vintage Metal Heater is an attractive addition to any home, with its old-school design (inspired by the original 1945 Vornadofan) and light color options of sage green or cream. It uses a unique heating design to better warm a room without blasting hot air; instead, vortex air circulation allows for more gentle yet effective heating. In addition to the two main power settings (low/high), there is an adjustable thermostat and a 47-degree pivoting head so that you can better customize the heat level and direction of airflow. As with the VH200, the VHEAT includes tip-over protection and automatic safety shut off for greater peace of mind, while the metal structure helps create a durable product that will last for years.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 8.7 inches deep x 13.7 inches high x 11 inches wide</li><li>Weight: 9.9 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 750W, 1500W</li><li>Material: Metal</li><li>Area Heated: Not listed</li><li>Price (at publish): $159.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Attractive, vintage design reminiscent of mid-century modern style</li><li>Unique Vortex Air circulation that encourages gentler, fast heating</li><li>47 degrees of adjustable movement for greater directional control</li><li>Standard safety features and a finger-friendly grill design to keep small hands safe</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Considerably more expensive than other products on the list</li><li>No eco- or energy-saver mode</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For an attractive heater that looks as good as it performs, the Vornado VHEAT heater is an investment buy that heats your room gently but quickly.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vornado VHEAT Vintage Metal Heater</a></p><h3>Best wall-mounted electric heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Heat Storm Phoenix Infrared Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wall-mounted electric heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Heat Storm Phoenix Floor to Wall Unit 1,500-Watt Infrared Quartz Portable Heater with Built-In Thermostat and Over Heat Sensor, White</h3></p><p>While a standing heater is portable, a wall-mounted electric heater frees up floor space and removes the risk of tripping. It’s a particularly good idea if you have kids or pets who might be a little too curious about the hot air blower! The Heat Storm Phoenix Infrared Heater is my pick for the best wall-mounted unit, thanks to its slim profile and clear digital display, which can dim during the night so as not to disrupt your sleep.</p><p>The heater comes with a control for remote access and features two power settings, with the higher setting able to heat 150 square feet as a primary method of heat, or 750 square feet as a secondary method. If you do want to detach it from the wall and place it on the floor, the Heat Storm includes attachable feet with your purchase. In addition to a tip-over switch, the unit includes a child lock, and the entire exterior is touchable and heat-proof. This costs a little over $100, which I think is a reasonable price for its heating abilities and space efficiency.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 18.75 inches wide x 4.5 inches deep x 12.75 inches high</li><li>Weight: 9 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 750W, 1500W</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Area Heated: 150 square feet (primary), 750 square feet (secondary)</li><li>Price (at publish): $105.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Slim silhouette makes it great for small spaces</li><li>Dimmable digital display for undisrupted sleep</li><li>Attachable feet included, should you want to repurpose it as a floor unit</li><li>Child-friendly, thanks to the child lock and heat-proof surfaces, including the grill</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Attachable feet are a bit flimsy</li><li>Not as powerful as a primary method of heat; only up to 150 square feet</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Heat Storm’s Phoenix Infrared Heater is a discreet, wall-mounted heater with a dimmable digital display, child-safe features and a mid-level price.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Heat Storm Phoenix Infrared Heater</a></p><h3>Best electric fireplace space heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>DuraFlame 3D Electric Fireplace Stove</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best electric fireplace space heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Duraflame Electric Stove in Red/Brown | 23.4 H x 24 W x 13.07 D in | Wayfair DFI-5010-03</h3></p><p>The DuraFlame 3D Electric Fireplace Stove is designed to be a centerpiece, not something you hide away in the corner. The flame function mimics the appearance of a real fire and can run with or without heating to enjoy the aesthetic, no matter the weather. Unlike some electric fireplaces, this one also comes in several colors, including navy and cinnamon, so you can be confident it will suit whichever room you put it in.</p><p>Infrared quartz heat helps to maintain the room’s natural humidity while adding warmth, which can heat a room up to 1,000 square feet in size. The DuraFlame stove is also easy to use, thanks to a control panel that features an adjustable thermostat, a timer, and five brightness settings. One thing to note is that you’ll pay a high price for this product ($230), and there are no safety features beyond overheat protection, so it may not be safe for small children or pets.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 13.07 inches deep x 24 inches high x 23.4 inches wide</li><li>Weight: 28.6 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 1500W</li><li>Material: Metal</li><li>Area Heated: Up to 1,000 square feet (secondary)</li><li>Price (at publish): $229.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Original fireplace design that can be enjoyed with or without the heating function</li><li>Infrared quartz heating ensures that the air keeps its natural humidity</li><li>Lots of customization options, including 5 brightness settings and an adjustable thermostat</li><li>Multiple attractive colors</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive at over $200</li><li>Minimal safety features, so not as safe for children or pets</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Enjoy the look and coziness of a fireplace year-round with the DuraFlame 3D Electric Fireplace Stove, which mimics a fire, heats the room, and looks stylish at the same time.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>DuraFlame 3D Electric Fireplace Stove</a></p><h3>Best family-friendly heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>PUR Honeywell ThermaWave Ceramic Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best family-friendly heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Honeywell ThermaWave 6 Ceramic Technology Space Heater, White – Ceramic Heater with Programmable Thermostat</h3></p><p>Not only does the PUR Honeywell ThermaWave Ceramic Heater look sleek and modern, it features a few additional safety features that make it a great family-friendly model. As well as the standard tip-over shutoff function, the Honeywell has two separate overheat protections and an outer plastic shell that stays cool to the touch throughout use.</p><p>There are also three different timer settings (two, four, or eight hours), so whether you have curious children or pets, you can rest easy that they’ll be safe around this heater. The air vents are placed on the upper part of the heater, allowing it to more effectively direct warm air around a room than some ground units, although keep in mind that these vents can’t be redirected downwards. Overall, we think this heater looks and performs like a heater that’s much more expensive than it is.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 18.4 inches wide x 8.43 inches deep x 18 inches high</li><li>Weight: 10.63 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 1500W</li><li>Material: Ceramic</li><li>Area Heated: Not listed</li><li>Price (at publish): $84.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sleek, modern aesthetic that will fit neatly into many homes</li><li>Additional safety protocols and a cool-touch feel make it safe for small hands</li><li>Multiple timer options for added peace of mind</li><li>Good price for the performance and look</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Air vents can’t be moved in any other direction</li><li>Takes up more space than others on this list</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The PUR Honeywell ThermaWave Ceramic Heater looks grown-up and expensive yet is child-friendly, affordable, and quick to heat up large spaces.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>PUR Honeywell ThermaWave Ceramic Heater</a></p><h3>Best portable electric heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dreo Solaris Slim H3</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best portable electric heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Dreo Space Heater, Portable Electric Heaters for Indoor Use, 70° Oscillation, 12H Timer, 1500W Quiet PTC Ceramic Heating with Remote for Office, Home Bedroom</h3></p><p>The Dreo Solaris Slim H3 looks more like a portable speaker than a heater, thanks to its six-inch by six-inch footprint and 16-inch height. Weighing under five pounds and with a hidden handle, this column unit is easy to carry and stylish wherever you put it down. The touch control panel features several buttons, including a favorite temperature setting and an oscillating function of 70 degrees for greater heating efficiency. There’s also a remote control if you want to operate the device from further away.</p><p>The Dreo Solaris Slim can heat areas up to 200 square feet and can reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit in just two seconds, making it much more powerful than its size suggests. The black color and metallic accents make it look expensive, but this heater costs under $70. It’s also very quiet on any of its five settings. The only cause for caution is that the grill can get hot after extended use, so children and pets should be supervised while it’s turned on.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 15.8 inches high x 5.9 inches wide x 5.9 inches deep</li><li>Weight: 4.6 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 900W, 1500W</li><li>Material: Ceramic</li><li>Area Heated: 200 square feet</li><li>Price (at publish): $67.49</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Attractive, modern design and small footprint for easy portability</li><li>Five power settings that are all quiet to use and able to heat rooms of up to 200 square feet</li><li>Touch control panel includes the option to save a favorite temperature</li><li>Low price of under $70</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The grill can get hot, which may be a safety risk for children or pets</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Dreo Solaris Slim H3 is incredibly powerful for its size and stylish for its price, with five power settings packed into a small, 5 lb unit.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dreo Solaris Slim H3</a></p><h3>Best heater with smart features: <a rel=nofollow href=#>BOLDR FARA Smart Energy Saving Desktop Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best heater with smart features</span></p><p><h3 class=title>BOLDR FARA Smart Energy Saving Desktop Heater</h3></p><p>All you need from your electric heater is the ability to turn on and warm up a room, but additional smart capabilities can really streamline and elevate the experience. BOLDR’s FARA Smart Energy Desktop Heater is designed to support optional add-on smart features, all linked to a smartphone application. From this app, users can adjust the temperature of different zones in the house from anywhere; you could set the house to begin warming up on your way home or switch off the heater upstairs while you’re downstairs.</p><p>Real-time cost monitoring allows you to measure your energy consumption at any time, and you can set a heating schedule so that your FARA heater knows exactly when to run for greater energy efficiency. FARA also connects to voice devices like Google Home and Alexa so that you can control your heating through convenient voice commands.</p><p>Even without the smart features, this is a nifty little heater: Weighing just 1.5 pounds, this desktop unit can comfortably and attractively slot into any space and still has the power to heat spaces up to 215 square feet. Unsurprisingly, this comes at a higher price of $160, but if you appreciate smart functionality, then this price will be a steal.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 7.87 inches high x 5.12 inches wide x 4.72 inches deep</li><li>Weight: 1.5 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 1200W</li><li>Material: Ceramic</li><li>Area Heated: 215 square feet</li><li>Price (at publish): $160.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Smartphone app allows for remote access from anywhere for convenience and energy efficiency</li><li>Small desktop size and low weight make it portable and versatile</li><li>Stylish appearance and slick user experience</li><li>Real-time cost monitoring helps you measure and adjust your energy consumption</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Higher price of $160</li><li>Small size makes it slower to heat up larger rooms</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The BOLDR FARA Desktop Heater is smart in appearance and design, with a convenient app that allows for remote access, real-time cost monitoring, and schedule setting.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>BOLDR FARA Smart Energy Saving Desktop Heater</a></p><h3>Best oil-filled heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>De'Longhi Dragon Oil Filled Radiator Heater</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best oil-filled heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>De'Longhi Dragon Oil Filled Radiator Heater</h3></p><p>While most space heaters nowadays are ceramic, oil-filled heaters are ideal for heating large spaces for longer periods of time. They take longer to warm up, but the results linger, creating a more ambient warmth that’s great for gatherings or slow, cozy evenings in. The De’Longhi Dragon Oil Filled Radiator Heater is my favorite of the bunch, thanks to its sturdy construction and ergonomic portability; although it’s a larger heater at 25 pounds, front and rear handles plus smart snap wheels ensure easy mobility.</p><p>The De’Longhi heater is silent when in use and has 75% more surface area than competitors for more efficient heat distribution. Because it doesn’t deploy a fan, there’s no risk of stirring up dust or drying out the air like some ceramic models. It also features a tip-over switch, overheat protection, and a child lock, plus a cool-touch coating to keep small hands safe. For energy-conscious users, this heater offers an Eco Plus mode and a range of temperature and power levels, with a programmable 24-hour timer.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 25 inches high x 16 inches deep x 6.5 inches wide</li><li>Weight: 25 lbs</li><li>Wattage: 1500W</li><li>Material: Metal, oil</li><li>Area Heated: Not listed</li><li>Price (at publish): $129.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sturdy, safe, ergonomic design with 75% more surface area for efficient heat distribution</li><li>No risk of stirring up dust or allergens, or drying out the air</li><li>Silent when in use and good at creating long-lasting ambient temperature</li><li>Lots of customization available, with an Eco Plus mode and multiple temperature settings</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Larger and bulkier than other heaters on this list</li><li>Takes longer to warm up than ceramic models</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For long-lasting ambient warmth, the De’Longhi Dragon Oil Filled Radiator Heater is a sturdy, silent heater that works slowly but effectively over long periods of time.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>De'Longhi Dragon Oil Filled Radiator Heater</a></p><h3>Most versatile electric heater: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Link Purifier HP02</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most versatile electric heater</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Dyson Pure Hot+Cool Link™ Purifier Heater Fan HP02</h3></p><p>If you’re willing to splurge on a state-of-the-art, multidimensional appliance, then the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool HP02 is a powerful product that does it all.

They also vary when it comes to safety features, aesthetics, price, smart capabilities, and added functionality. For this piece, I researched each model in depth and assessed the heaters on the above criteria, as well as taking into account the first-hand experience of industry experts and the general public.</p><p>I also considered the different needs and budgets of potential customers and looked for heaters that consistently performed over long periods of time. I incorporated the guidance of industry professionals and my own first-hand experience so that I could draw up a list that represented the most three-dimensional experience of each of these products.</p><h2 id=are-electric-heaters-cheaper-than-central-heating>Are electric heaters cheaper than central heating?</h2><p>Central heating uses gas for energy, instead of the electricity used by space heaters. As gas is generally cheaper than electricity, central heating tends to be more affordable than electric heaters when used to heat the same amount of space. This will, of course, vary depending on where you live and the utility prices in your area. However, electric heaters can be much more targeted in their heat emission than radiators or other central air units, which means they are very effective in smaller spaces.</p><p>Central heating might take more overall energy to get a single room to the temperature you want, as it could be heating other rooms as well. If you’re looking to just raise the temperature of a single space, then electric heaters can be overall more cost effective than turning on central heating. You can enhance this by utilizing energy-saving modes on your heater, monitoring your consumption, and looking for models that automatically shut off once the desired temperature has been reached.</p><h2 id=how-long-do-electric-heaters-last>How long do electric heaters last?</h2><p>Electric heaters can last as long as five to ten years, depending on the unit you have, the frequency of use, and the amount of maintenance conducted. Heaters that are left on all day or even for days on end will likely break sooner than electric heaters that are used more sparingly. Some models on this list have a warranty of up to five years, and others, such as the De’Longhi Oil Filled Heater, are considered more durable and long-lasting than ceramic heaters. In general, you can expect several years of use as long as you take care of your unit.</p><h2 id=what-type-of-heater-is-best>What type of heater is best?</h2><p>This will all come down to personal preference. Some heaters are designed to heat the immediate surroundings quickly (radiant heat), while others heat the entire room but at a slower pace (convection heat). Portability may be important for some people who want to heat multiple rooms but only one at a time, while others may prioritize power and heat efficiency in a single space. A higher price doesn’t always mean a more effective heater; the price may also include elevated design features, smart capabilities, and a more fashionable look. This may be worth it to some but not to others, so the best one is the one that works for you.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do electric heaters use a lot of electricity?</h3><p>Nearly all of the electric heaters on this list use 1500W when at high power. This is quite a lot of electricity; while you can plug any of these heaters into a standard wall outlet, it is recommended that you don’t use them with an extension cord as this may overload it and cause a fire. However, electric heaters convert all of this electricity into heat, making them energy efficient. To maximize effectiveness while minimizing energy use, it is recommended that electric heaters be used as supplementary heat, not the sole source of heat in the home.</p><h3>Are electric heaters safe?</h3><p>In general, electric heaters are approved for indoor use, but we’ve also made sure to only include electric heaters that feature basic safety functions such as overheat protection. This ensures that the device will turn off once it reaches a certain heat threshold, reducing the risk of harm or fire. Tip-over switches, cool-touch coatings, and child locks can all improve the safety of a heater for greater peace of mind. It is generally recommended that electric heaters not be left on overnight just as an added safety precaution, in case of an automatic shut-off malfunction.</p><h3>How much are electric heaters?</h3><p>Electric heaters can be available for as low as $30, while other models can cost several hundreds of dollars. The price will depend on the materials used, the size of the unit, its additional features and smart capabilities, and its aesthetic. More expensive units are not necessarily better at heating but may offer valuable other components such as eco-modes, remote access, or air purification.</p><h3>How long can electric space heaters be left on for?</h3><p>It is recommended that electric space heaters only be used for a few hours at a time and not left to run overnight to reduce the risk of overheating or malfunction. In the worst cases, a heater left on for too long could create a fire hazard, although all of the devices on this list feature automatic shut-off and overheat protection. Another reason to reduce the duration of the heating is that electric heaters use a lot of energy, so it can be very expensive to run a space heater for hours on end. Instead, these units are effective at shorter-term, direct heating of small spaces, as opposed to long-term ambient heating; for that, central heating is likely to be more efficient, safe, and affordable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llaGypMDRoppmoJWWwaa%2B0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-electric-heaters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-electric-heaters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-electric-heaters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-electric-heaters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-electric-heaters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-electric-heaters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./judge-with-a-passion-for-civil-rights.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./judge-with-a-passion-for-civil-rights.html>Judge With a Passion For Civil Rights</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./all-the-betty-and-jughead-relationship-moments-on-riverdale-so-far.html>All the Betty and Jughead relationship moments on 'Riverdale' so far</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./all-the-betty-and-jughead-relationship-moments-on-riverdale-so-far.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
