He began as an outlaw, but became a leader of men, taking victory over the English at Stirling Bridge in 1297. He was not of noble blood, and perhaps this is why his memory is held so dear. He was executed as a traitor in London in 1305.</p><p>Several monuments still stand to his memory in Scotland today including the Wallace National Monument just outside Stirling which also houses the sword he was reputed to wield.&nbsp;</p><h3>Robert the Bruce</h3><p>Born in 1274, Robert the Bruce became King of Scotland in 1306. Edward I of England took immediate action forcing him into hiding. It's believed that during this time, Bruce saw a spider trying to build a web, and it was the spider's perseverance that inspired him to carry on fighting the English. After the death of Edward I in 1307, Bruce defeated Edward II's armies at Bannockburn in 1314. This was a turning point in the war, and Bruce was eventually victorious with the English.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mary Queen of Scots</h3><p>Mary Queen of Scots (1542-1587) was crowned when she was just nine months old. Mary often found herself trapped between warring political factions, each trying to use her to enhance their power. Mary married three times, first to Francis, Dauphin of France, but she was to be widowed after only a year. She then married Lord Darnley, believing it would secure her children's right to the English throne, but it was a poor match.

He was imprisoned for a time but was eventually pardoned.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bonnie Prince Charlie</h3><p>Grandson of King James VII of Scotland and II of England, Bonnie Prince Charlie, (1720 â€“ 1788) believed he was the rightful heir to the thrones of Scotland, England and Ireland.</p><p>He is best known as the instigator of the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, which ended in defeat at the Battle of Culloden. He fled Scotland to France, where he died aged 67. He became a romantic hero for the Scots and the tale of his escape with the help of Flora MacDonald, still captures the imagination.&nbsp;</p><h3>Flora Macdonald</h3><p>In 1746, Flora helped Bonnie Prince Charlie escape Scotland after the Battle of Culloden. Aged just 24, she disguised the prince as a woman&nbsp;and took him by boat to Skye, an event recalled in the Skye Boat song.</p><p>He safely escaped, but Flora was arrested and spent some time in the Tower of London. Released in 1747, she emigrated to North Carolina with her husband&nbsp;but returned to Scotland in 1779. She died in 1790 and was buried on the Isle of Skye.</p><p>Find out more about <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>famous Scots at VisitScotland&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Scottish sportspeople</h2><h3>Andy Murray</h3><p>Born in 1987 in Glasgow, Andy Murray became the world's No.1 ranked tennis player in 2016.
