If you prefer to carry a lot of items while on the go versus the limited amount you can stuff into a purse or fanny pack, travel totes are the ultimate solution.. They're spacious, versatile, and can fit all your essentials, including your laptop, charger, makeup, and even your beach towel. Plus, they come in a variety of materials, styles, and sizes, so you can find one that matches your taste to a T.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-travel-tote>How to choose the best travel tote</h2><p>When it comes to choosing the best travel tote, there are several factors to consider. Here are some things to keep in mind when selecting a tote that will meet your needs:</p><h3>What size is ideal for your travel needs?</h3><p>Consider the length of your trip and the amount of items you need to bring with you. If you're going on a weekend getaway or short trip, a smaller tote might be sufficient. However, if you're traveling for longer periods, you'll need a tote that is spacious enough to accommodate all your belongings. Keep in mind that airlines have size restrictions for carry-on bags, so make sure to check the measurements before purchasing.</p><h3>What material will hold up best during travel—and at your destination?</h3><p>Travel totes come in a range of materials, including canvas, leather, nylon, and more. Depending on your destination and travel activities, you'll need to choose a material that's appropriate for the conditions you'll be facing. For example, if you're traveling to a beach location, you'll need a tote made of a waterproof or water-resistant material. If you're going on a hiking trip, you might want to choose a tote made of a durable material that can withstand rugged conditions.</p><h3>Is it something that’ll be easy to carry?</h3><p>A good travel tote should be comfortable to carry, especially if you'll be carrying it for extended periods of time. Look for totes with padded straps, adjustable straps, or other features that will make it easier to carry. If you're traveling to a city destination and will be using public transportation, you'll want a tote that's easy to carry on your shoulder or across your body.</p><h3>Will it actually keep you organized?</h3><p>Keeping your belongings organized while traveling can be a challenge. Look for a tote that has compartments or pockets to help you keep your items separated and easy to find. Some totes also come with removable pouches or inserts that make it easy to pack and unpack. If you’re moving around a lot, especially through busy cities, consider a tote that snaps or zippers closed for security, or at least one with a zippered compartment for valuables.</p><h2 id=our-top-travel-tote-picks>Our top travel tote picks</h2><p>We've rounded up the best travel totes in different categories, including budget-friendly options, designer totes, and bags made of leather, canvas, and more.
