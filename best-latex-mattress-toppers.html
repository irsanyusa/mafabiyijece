According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr. Kellen Scantlebury</a>, physical therapist and founder of Fit Club NY, a quality mattress topper can be a great way to ease pain and add comfort to your sleep routine. Though you’ll find toppers made out of all types of materials, latex mattress toppers have some unique advantages. Unlike memory foam, which tends to sink beneath your weight and mold to your form, latex toppers are known for being bouncy and buoyant, providing enough resistance to cushion the joints. They’re also breathable, making them a popular option for hot sleepers, and they’re one of the most durable and longest-lasting types of <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress toppers</a> on the market.</p><h2 id=our-top-latex-mattress-topper-picks>Our top latex mattress topper picks</h2><h3>Best value latex mattress topper: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sleep on Latex Pure Green Natural Latex Mattress Topper</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best for Extra Cooling</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Pure Green Natural Latex Mattress Topper - Soft - 2 Inch - Queen Size (GOLS Certified Organic)</h3></p><p>Latex mattress toppers tend to be pricier than memory foam or down toppers, though it depends on brand and style. But the Sleep On Latex Pure Green Natural Latex topper proves that a latex topper doesn’t have to break your budget. The Pure Green is a Dunlop style topper that’s ultra soft, GOLs certified organic, and constructed with a breathable, perforated surface for extra cooling. And with most of Pure Green’s size and height options priced under $200, it’s a steal compared to other latex mattress toppers on the market.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Firmness: Soft</li><li>Height: 1 inch- 3 inch</li><li>Sizes: Twin - CA King</li><li>Trial Period: 30 days</li><li>Delivery: Free</li><li>Price: $100-$325 without cover</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Latex is sourced directly from Sri Lanka</li><li>Affordably priced</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Cover is sold separately for an additional fee</li><li>Only available in firmness level “soft,” which may not work for stomach and back sleepers</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This topper is plush and affordable.

Offering two inches of GOLS-certified organic latex nestled in an organic cotton cover, the My Green Mattress Plush Latex Topper has a firmness rating of 14-18 ILD, which is ultra-soft. This topper delivers that classic, cloud-like pillow-top feel, allowing side sleepers to finally rest easy. If that’s not enough, consider switching out your current mattress for one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best mattresses for side sleepers</a> and upgrading your pillows to a <a rel=alternate href=#>pillow made for side sleepers</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Firmness: 14-18 ILD</li><li>Height: 2 inches</li><li>Sizes: Twin to California King</li><li>Trial Period: 365 days</li><li>Delivery: Free in continental U.S..</li><li>Price: $185 $349</li><li>5-year warranty</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Ultra soft</li><li>365-night sleep trial offers peace of mind</li><li>Cotton cover is included</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t offer a 3-inch option</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An affordable and plush topper that’s especially appealing for side sleepers.</p><h3>Best latex mattress topper for back pain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sleep EZ Natural Latex Topper</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best for Back Pain</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Sleep EZ Natural Latex Topper</h3></p><p>Nothing disrupts your quality of life quite like an aching back. According to Scantlebury, choosing the right latex mattress topper for your back pain will come down to where that pain is located. For lower back pain, an extra-firm mattress provides the best support, whereas people with upper back and neck pain will feel most comfortable on a medium-firm mattress. “In my own personal case, I had low back pain, and I had a very soft mattress. So I got a firmer mattress topper, and it’s so much better,” he shares. The Sleep EZ Natural Latex Topper is our pick for back pain because it offers a wide variety of different firmness levels to suit every need, including medium, firm, and extra firm. The Sleep EZ also offers toppers in either a Talalay style or a Dunlop style, allowing you to further customize the firmness level, bounce, and density of your latex mattress topper.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Firmness: 4 firmness options from soft to extra firm</li><li>Height: 2-3 inches</li><li>Sizes: Twin-California King</li><li>Trial Period: 90 days less a $99 return fee</li><li>Delivery: Free in the U,S.</li><li>Price: $189-$599</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Family-owned business</li><li>Highly customizable</li><li>They will cut your topper to a custom size upon request</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Cover is sold separately for an added fee</li><li>Returns are not free</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is a great option for anyone who wants to customize their topper—and it’s especially ideal for those with back pain.</p><h3>Best cooling latex mattress topper: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Birch Plush Organic Mattress Topper</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best for Sweaty Sleepers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Birch Plush Organic Mattress Topper</h3></p><p>All latex toppers are somewhat breathable by design, but the Birch Plush Organic Mattress topper is constructed with three different cooling layers for a deliciously chilly sleep. These Birch toppers start with a layer of eco-INSTITUT certified Talalay latex, featuring a perforated design that’s formulated to increase airflow. Resting on top of the latex is a layer of hypoallergenic organic wool. Wool is known to wick away moisture, making it an ideal material for sweaty sleepers.

Here are a few easy ways to narrow down your choices:</p><h3>Know the difference between Dunlop and Talalay</h3><p>Latex mattress toppers come in two basic styles: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dunlop and Talalay</a>. These styles stem from two different production methods, with the Talalay method resulting in a softer and bouncier topper and the Dunlop method creating toppers that are heavier and denser but also more durable. Because the production method for Talalay toppers is more involved, it is often more expensive.</p><p>But whether to choose Dunlop or Talalay is only one consideration: You’ll also want to look at the other factors that impact your comfort, like the topper’s height and firmness level, as well as practical considerations like price point, return policy, and <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress size</a>.</p><h3>Check the ILD rating</h3><p>The best measure of a latex mattress topper’s firmness is its’ ILD rating. <a rel=nofollow href=#>ILD</a> stands for “impression load deflection,” and it’s a firmness scale that tops out at about 50 ILD. The higher the ILD, the firmer the mattress topper will be.</p><h3>Consider any pain issues</h3><p>According to Scantlebury, the first step in choosing a good mattress topper when you are experiencing pain is identifying where the pain is centered in your body: “Usually for low <a rel=alternate href=#>back pain</a>, I suggest an extra-firm mattress topper,” he says. And then a moderate-to-firm topper is best for anyone with neck pain, just something that can give them a little more support. The more your body sinks into the mattress topper, the less support you have, so typically, people with back and neck pain find that to be a little less comfortable.”</p><h3>Factor in your sleep position</h3><p>Sleep position is also a major factor in choosing the right topper. As Scantlebury describes, there are three main sleeping positions: stomach, back, and side. “Side sleepers typically will go with a softer mattress. If you’re sleeping on your side, your hip bones, in particular, may dig into a firmer mattress topper, and that can be uncomfortable,” he shares. “So anyone who is a side sleeper, I suggest they get a softer topper to allow the topper to contort around their hips and other bony areas.” Side sleepers may be drawn to the softer texture of Talalay latex for that same reason or a very plush Dunlop-style topper.</p><p>“If they are back sleepers, I encourage them to have more of a medium-firm mattress topper, not super soft, and not super firm,” Scantlebury says. “Maintaining that spinal alignment during sleep really helps them to sleep comfortably.”</p><p>For stomach sleepers, Scantlebury suggests an extra-firm style. “You want to stay away from a softer mattress topper because it will facilitate something called ‘anterior tilt’, which puts more strain on your low back. So, I try to help reduce that strain on their low back by encouraging them to get a firmer mattress topper if they are stomach sleepers.”</p><h2 id=what-is-a-latex-topper>What is a latex topper?</h2><p>Latex mattress toppers are meant to be positioned on top of your mattress and below the fitted sheet. They’re useful for adjusting the firmness level of your sleep surface and for providing extra comfort and support.</p><p>Natural latex is made from the liquified sap of rubber trees, which is harvested, processed, and poured into molds. Synthetic latex uses a similar production process, but instead of being derived from rubber sap, it’s produced from petroleum compounds. While synthetic latex is cheaper and more sturdy, it can also be stiff, as it lacks the classic elasticity and bounciness of natural latex.</p><p>Many toppers on the market are actually a blend of natural and synthetic latex, but if you’re seeking the highest-quality option available, then all-natural latex is the way to go. So, how can you tell if your latex mattress topper is made of all-natural latex vs. a synthetic blend? Check to see if the product has recognized third-party certifications, such as from GOLS or the Eco Institute. If it’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>GOLS-certified</a>, that means it contains at least 95% organic latex. And if it’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>eco-INSTITUT-certified</a>, then it will contain 100% natural latex fibers.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-a-latex-topper-cost>How much does a latex topper cost?</h2><p>Latex mattress toppers vary wildly in price, depending on factors like size and height. Twin-sized latex mattress toppers can be found for $100 or less, whereas the most deluxe California King toppers max out at over $900. But for an average queen-size topper with a 2-inch height, expect to spend between $200-400 for a quality latex topper and over $500 for a deluxe latex topper.</p><p>Another factor that affects price is whether the cover is included or sold separately. Although it’s not necessary to use a cover with your topper, covers are usually machine washable, so using one will help you keep your topper clean and reduce wear and tear. Covers can also add comfort, cooling effects, and style.</p><p>Many of the cheaper latex mattress toppers on the market are available with their cover sold separately for an additional fee, averaging around $100 for a queen-sized cover. The higher the price-point for the latex mattress topper, the more likely it is that the cover will be included.</p><h2 id=who-are-latex-mattress-toppers-right-for>Who are latex mattress toppers right for?</h2><p>Latex mattress toppers are a great choice if you want to breathe new life into an old mattress, soften up a too-firm mattress, or add support to a mattress that’s grown soft and saggy.</p><p>There are many different types of mattress toppers to choose from, including memory foam and down, but latex has some qualities that set it apart. It’s bouncier and more buoyant than memory foam, making it ideal for those who dislike memory foam’s sinkage. The bounciness of latex also gives it an edge over traditional down toppers, which can tend to flatten quickly.</p><p>According to Scantlebury, the superior thickness, elasticity, and bounce of latex would also be beneficial to people experiencing physical pain, especially in their neck and back.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How long does a latex mattress topper last?</h3><p>Most retailers offer a minimum 1-year warranty on their latex mattress toppers, and some offer a 5-year warranty or more. Since latex is a durable material, a well-cared-for natural latex topper should last for many years.</p><h3>Where can I buy a latex mattress topper?</h3><p>Latex mattress toppers can be purchased online and delivered to your home, often with free shipping included. You can also shop for a latex mattress topper in person: most major mattress retailers also sell mattress toppers. However, call ahead to ensure that they offer the latex mattress topper of your choice.</p><h3>Is latex or memory foam better for a mattress topper?</h3><p>According to Scantlebury, whether to choose latex or memory foam depends on the specific needs of your body. Latex toppers typically offer more bounce and resistance, whereas memory foam can sink underneath your weight and mold to your form. “The bounce factor in latex would be beneficial for anyone experiencing back pain, and also particularly beneficial for stomach sleepers as well.”</p><h3>Are latex mattress toppers worth it?</h3><p>Latex mattress toppers are often more expensive than memory foam or traditional down toppers, but their unique bounciness, resistance, and support justify the higher price. And with a little research, you can also find quality, budget-friendly latex mattress toppers too.
