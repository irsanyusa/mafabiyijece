After winning the talent competition, the young actor secured his first TV role by guest starring in <i>Zeke and Luther</i>, Disney’s XD series. Just like in the talent competition, he performed exceptionally in the Disney show. He again auditioned and qualified for his first feature film in the horror movie <i>11/11/11</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a4eaf16e7f94c7c3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My manhood works perfectly but being a guy doesn't fetch me money, James Brown says in new interview</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Megan Olivi</a> bio: age, height, husband and hot photos</p><p class=align-left>He then went on to become more popular when he landed the role of Micah Watson in the NBC comedy-drama series <i>Parenthood</i>. By 2012, he had begun making appearances in a recurring role and had starred in five episodes by 2014. It was not long before the young star began to expand his body of work by venturing into <a href=# title="Hayden Byerly career" rel="nofollow noopener">voice acting roles</a>. His voice was used in video games such as <i>Lightning Returns</i>: <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i>, <i>Lego Marvel's Avengers</i>, and <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</i>. Moreover, he voiced a character in Sofia the First, an animated series where he played Prince Gustav.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a3d287cdaeebd12d.jpg><p class=align-left>He ended his first two years in the acting scene by further escalating his resume with a range of projects. In 2013, he climbed further and was assigned the role of a lead cast member of <i>The Fosters</i>, where he played the character Jude Adams Foster. His controversial role of the adopted 12-year-old boy who faced abuse received critical acclaim. The most notable one is when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hollywood.com listed his name</a> among the Favorite LGBTQ Characters on TV due to his convincing nature and human attributes. It is this character portrayal that sparked Hayden Byerly gay rumours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ca447a24fb8eb2f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Davido shows off impressive table tennis skills as he plays against celebrity jeweller</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Just like most young actors, his education runs on a set of requirements for young actors and actresses. Acting aside, his other interests include reading mystery and action adventure books as well as playing video games and basketball. He also loves making himself busy with a little mathematics. He may still be young and somewhat inexperienced, but he never shies away from voicing different social issues such as bullying in schools. Notably, he is among the outspoken supporters of the campaign ‘<a id=https://www.customink.com/fundraising/staytruetoyou href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Be Good to Each Other</a>’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a4eaf16e7f94c7c3.jpg><h2>Hayden’s family and girlfriend</h2><p class=align-left>It is quite puzzling how some actors manage to keep their families hidden from the limelight, and Hayden is no exception. His parent’s identity is away from the public eye, but he has a younger brother. As mentioned earlier, the family resides in California.</p><p class=align-left>Hayden is known to have had a healthy love life with <a id=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7191249/ href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Alyssa Jirrels</a> who also happens to be a renowned actress. The couple had been seeing each other since 2015 and were spotted together in numerous public events. They were also never shy from expressing their love on social media.

Hayden knows this very well, and he has been subject to gay rumours ever since he played the James Foster role. However, this information is wrong as the star vehemently denied the rumours and affirmed that he is straight in real life.</p><h2>Hayden Byerly’s wealth information</h2><p class=align-left>At the moment, there is no much information regarding the actor’s net worth. However, it would be true to note that the star has raised his net worth from the numerous roles as an American actor. <i>Parenthood</i> is his longest-running TV stint, and it rakes in significant income for the star. Also, <i>The Fosters </i>is among his most recognisable shows and has amassed lots of viewers from different parts of the globe. The project has been crucial in increasing his net worth and definitely came with better earnings for the star.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jake DeVito biography: who is one of Danny Devito’s children?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f8fcaca9d1393e5.jpg><p class=align-left>The actor may have a few TV and film credits, but he has been able to acquire significant income from these as well as the voice roles.
