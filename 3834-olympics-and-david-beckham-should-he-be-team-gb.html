Some feel the 37 year-old former England captain is past his prime as a footballer, however, and <a href=#>others have argued</a> that only the best players should represent Britain at the Olympics.</p><h2>In YouGov’s SportsLab, we wanted to hear your view – Do you think leaving David Beckham off Team GB was the right or wrong decision?</h2><p><b>Over 1,000 of you took part in this discussion, and you were almost split down the middle over whether leaving David Beckham off Team GB was the right or wrong course of action.</b></p><h2><b>We also invited you to give your reactions to <a href=#>comments</a><b> made by Sir Ian Wright, the former Arsenal player and now football commentator, that football should not be part of the Olympics.</b></b></h2><p>Scroll down to read our breakdown of your discussion here in Labs.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><b>Tell us your view: Should David Beckham have been chosen for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics?</b></h2><h2><b>How do you think the Team GB football squad will perform at the Olympics?</b></h2><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>1. <strong>Was leaving David Beckham off Team GB the right or wrong decision?</strong></h2><h2>A slightly higher proportion of participants said Stuart Pearce had made the <i>wrong</i> decision excluding Beckham.</h2><ul><li><b>Participants holding this stance argued that giving him one of 18 spots on the squad was a reasonable reward for all he has done for the London 2012 Olympics, football, and Britain as a whole.</b></li><li><b>Many of you told us that you view David Beckham as an effective and admirable ambassador for Britain</b>, who has done a lot to raise the profile of his nation and his sport in a positive way.

In addition, I still believe he is more than capable still at this level” <i>Morgsuk, Rochford</i></p><p>“<b>He has been such an ambassador for English football and the London Olympics</b>. The Olympic football tournament shouldn't be taken as seriously as, say, the European Championship, and <b>despite David Beckham no longer playing at the very top of domestic football, his inclusion in the squad would not have a negative effect on the collective ability</b>” <i>Neil B, Halifax</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/YG_LifeStory_Becks.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<b>David Beckham has played a crucial role in winning us the Olympics</b>, as well as in the build-up to the games. <b>Becks is known around the world and is probably as well known as the Queen</b>. <b>For all that he has done for charity, football, and the UK as a whole, I think that he deserves a place in the squad</b> and I would have picked him over Craig Bellamy as an over 23 member” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>After all he's done for football and the Olympic bid</b>, he's one of the biggest sports stars on the planet, he would have put bums on seats and <b>I'm sure the British public would have wanted to show their appreciation of him for, perhaps for the last time</b>” <i>Stu J, Westhoughton</i></p><p>“<b>Having Becks in the team would be a great reward for his patriotism and all he's done to deliver the Olympics to London, and his contribution to football</b>. Micah Richards is a player who decided not to be considered for the Euros because he was going to be on the reserve list – disgraceful. <b>… I have tickets to the final hoping that Becks and the boys would be there. It's slightly tarnished now</b>” <i>Angie, London</i></p><p>“<b>David Beckham has been an ambassador for sport in the UK including the Olympics</b>. Surely he could have been included in the Team GB squad. <b>His presence would have been an inspiration to the young members of the team</b> and he did not have to be an automatic choice to play” <i>Doug S, Emsworth</i></p><p>“<b>He may well be past his best, but his knowledge of football and leadership on and off the pitch would be invaluable and an excellent incentive for the younger guys</b>” <i>Andi, Ebbw Vale</i></p><p>“<b>I feel that David Beckham is an ideal diplomat on and off the field for Great Britain</b>. He has been involved in all aspects of the games, and has worked his socks off. <b>He is of a calibre that would motivate the rest of the team, as he would give 110% for his team, country and his own pride</b>” <i>Ken</i></p><p>“<b>All the things Beckham has done for the London Olympics should alone be good enough to put him at least in the squad</b>. Having him in the squad would increase interest from around the world (including us Brits) into Olympic football and the Olympics as a whole. <b>Having him come on just as a sub would cause a buzz from fans around the stadium, plus shirt sales would also increase</b>” <i>Rob K, Rushden</i></p><h3>VIEWPOINT: 'Leaving David Beckham off Team GB was the RIGHT decision'</h3><p>“<b>He's a famous name rather than a current high-status player</b>; with such limited places available, precedence has to be given to someone who is currently at the top of their game” <i>Cat, Pompey</i></p><p>“He’s not one of the best players anymore. <b>We should be playing to win, not building a team based on rewarding other activity or legacies</b>” <i>Beth J, Woking</i></p><p>“Beckham is too old and is no longer playing top, competitive football. <b>He is a symbol now, a memory of a player that had his moments on the pitch, but has had more moments off the pitch in recent years</b>. It was the right decision to omit him. <b>No one has the right to a place simply because they are an Olympic ambassador</b>” <i>David P, Newcastle</i></p><p>“<b>All Olympic teams should be chosen on merit</b>. You can't buy everything in this world and he just isn't good enough. <b>His time in the England team was extended way beyond what he merited, and it is about time he walked away with great satisfaction with what he has achieved in his career</b>. In addition, it would be an even greater mistake for him to light the Olympic torch in the Olympic Stadium. It should be someone who has an Olympic history, such as Sir Steve Redgrave. Beckham wouldn't even begin to compare!” <i>Laurie K, New Forest</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/3-goal-scoring_mbwF16n.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<b>He's not good enough to play for England (based on selection for the Euros), so why would he be good enough to play for the UK?</b> He's popular, he's apparently a nice bloke, but would he make the team better?” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>He is only wanted as a crowd puller. He is a favourite with the people making money, not the sports-minded people.</b> He is a great example to other players on what is achievable, but he is past his best” <i>George, Worcester</i></p><p>“<b>Although an admirer of David Beckham, his decision to pursue a career playing soccer in America leaves him without match practice at an appropriate level</b>. A Beckham in his prime would be good in any British team” <i>Art L, Reading</i></p><p>“<b>He would overshadow the whole team and hog the limelight. The object of entering is to win, not self-glorification</b>. There are plenty of players who will not get the chances he had with United Real Madrid or England who deserve a chance for recognition” <i>Dave, Edgware</i></p><p>“<b>The team to compete at the Olympics is being selected on current footballing merit. No matter how good a player Beckham was, or how much he has given to our Olympic bid, he has no place in the team.</b> He should surely have been able to recognise this” <i>Bill G, Peckham</i></p><p>“<b>It is meant to be a serious competition and he's probably too far over the hill to compete properly</b>. Dedication to the cause goes with skill and physical ability – the latter likely to have deserted him somewhat. Conversely, <b>Micah Richards, who may be selected because of his skill and physical ability, should not be selected because of his lack of dedication</b> – his stance on not supporting England in current European competition” <i>Anon</i></p><h2></h2><h2>2. <strong>Should football even be part of the Olympics?</strong></h2><p>Talking about football in the Olympics <a href=#>in an interview with the Sun</a>, Ian Wright, the former Arsenal player and now football commentator, said:</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/IanWright.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"I’m not a big fan of football in the Olympics. I think the Olympics should just be for track and field, and people who really aspire to win a gold medal and it’s what their whole life’s work’s about, rather than it being in there for football … I was reading about a fella the other day who put himself on eBay to try to raise money to help him get to train, and you’ve got footballers saying ‘should I, shouldn’t I?’ It ain’t right for me.”</p><ul><li><b>Most of those who took part in the discussion agreed with Sir Ian, arguing that football gets enough attention with the wide variety of other tournaments and events serving the sport.</b></li><li><b>Participants argued that the Olympics isn’t taken that seriously in the football world, and therefore often Olympic teams are not comprised of the best players.</b> Many of you made the point that for athletes in sports like track and field, competing at the Olympic Games is the absolute pinnacle of their careers.

Alternatively, only allow amateur footballers to compete” <i>Iain, Glasgow</i></p><p>“<b>The Olympics is primarily about individual achievement. Adding football is unnecessary and will not be of interest to most sports fans</b>. With the wide choice of sports to watch on TV I will not be following football. <b>The fact that football tickets have not sold well is surely evidence of a general apathy</b>” <i>Doug S, Emsworth</i></p><p>“<b>I would prefer an amateur game for the Olympic not one full of overpaid prima-donnas</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>Football has been out of the Olympics for far too long.
