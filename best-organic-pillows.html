So how to find an organic pillow that works for you? “When looking at certifications for bedding, keep an eye out for <a href=# rel=nofollow>GOTS</a>, which indicates sustainable harvesting of the raw materials, environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing, and clear labeling,” says Sanchali Pal, founder and CEO of the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Commons App</a>, which helps shoppers track their carbon footprints and connect with sustainable brands. “Other certifications like <a href=# rel=nofollow>USDA Organic</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>BlueSign</a>, or <a href=# rel=nofollow>Standard 100 by OEKO-Tex</a> represent that fabrics are screened for chemicals like pesticides,” she adds.</p><p>As a pillow-picky sleeper myself, I know it can be hard to buy pillows online, so I’ve rounded up the best organic pillows at a variety of price points and styles.

This one uses a three-chamber construction system to make its soft version extra-soft and its firm version more supportive. The down stuffing is ethically sourced, as is the cotton used to make the shell, and with three different sizes available, it’s as close to a custom pillow as you’ll find.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Down</li><li>Cover: Organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Soft, medium, firm</li><li>Sizes: Standard, king</li><li>Trial: 30 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $159 - $179</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Down is certified cruelty-free</li><li>Different options from the same retailer makes it easy to customize a bed setup</li><li>Brand also sells sheets and duvets–I love a one-stop shop!</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Price point is high</li><li>Since they come in different sizes, you have to have a sense of what you want before you buy</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A crowd-pleasing organic pillow from an easy-to-shop brand.</p><h3>Best value organic pillow: <a href=# rel=nofollow>MoonRest Certified Organic Pillow Pack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best value organic pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>MoonRest CERTIFIED -%100 ORGANIC Natural fabric Bed Sleeping Pillow, Down-like Fill - Queen size - 20” X 30”</h3></p><p>If you’re savvy about searching on Amazon, it has a wealth of great organic bedding options at even better price points, and these organic pillows are no exception. They’re sold as packs of two, which makes them a strong contender for best guest room pillows, and I like that the brand offers a body pillow option for side-sleepers who like a little more support for knees, arms, and necks. The organic fill is hypoallergenic, so anyone with a down allergy or sensitivity should put these on their list!</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Hypoallergenic down-like fill</li><li>Cover: Cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Plush</li><li>Sizes: Standard, queen, king, body pillow, toddler</li><li>Trial: None</li><li>Price on publish: $14.97 - $61.97 for a two-pack</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Low price point—two pillows are under $100</li><li>Amazon Prime means shipping is fast and returns are easy</li><li>Bigger-than-average size range</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Fill is a synthetic material</li><li>Queen and king sizes don’t have much of a price difference</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An organic pillow at an unbeatable price point.</p><h3>Best organic pillow for neck pain sufferers: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Coyuchi Turiya Organic Latex Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organic pillow for neck pain sufferers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Coyuchi Turiya Organic Latex Pillow Standard Alpine White</h3></p><p>Anyone who’s woken up with a stiff neck knows it can be a day-ruiner, and while I can’t help you find a more comfortable sleeping position—I’m still working on my own best practices here!—I can recommend an organic pillow from Coyuchi made from plush latex. Designed specifically for healthy neck and spine alignment, this one has special indentations for your ears and head, making it easy to position yourself, and while it can take some time to get used to (that’s why the brand offers a 30-night trial period), I love that it attempts to tackle neck pain head on. Shopping tip: Coyuchi also made our lists for the <a href=# rel=alternate>best organic sheets</a> and <a href=# rel=alternate>best duvet covers</a>, in case you’d like to completely outfit your bed in one stop.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Latex</li><li>Cover: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Medium</li><li>Sizes: Standard</li><li>Trial: 30 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $148</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Coyuchi offers a 20% discount if you buy two</li><li>Gets to the root of neck pain by offering guidance for sleep positioning</li><li>Latex fill is GOLS-certified organic</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>There’s a learning curve!</li><li>Only comes in standard size</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An organic pillow that neck-pain sufferers will love.</p><h3>Best organic pillow for side sleepers: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Naturepedic Organic Side Sleeper Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organic pillow for side sleepers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Naturepedic Organic Side Sleeper Pillow</h3></p><p>Speaking from experience, finding comfortable <a href=# rel=alternate>pillows for side sleepers</a> can be a challenge—some are too firm, some are too soft, and some are too high, causing my neck to strain. Instead of looking solely at materials or firmness, focus on support and adjustability. This one from Naturepedic caught my attention because of its ingenious curved design and adjustable loft, making it easy for side sleepers to find a height that works for them. The filling, made of shredded latex, is easily accessible, meaning you can add and subtract until you’ve got the perfect fit every night. A 100-night trial period means you’ll have plenty of time to figure it out.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Shredded latex</li><li>Cover: Organic cotton knit</li><li>Firmness level: Adjustable</li><li>Sizes: Standard</li><li>Trial: 100 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $139</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Curved design and adjustable height work to alleviate stiff necks</li><li>Breathable cover helps keep the pillow cool throughout the night</li><li>Long trial period</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Shape takes some getting used to</li><li>You’ll have to find a place to store the shredded latex core if you want to hold onto it after making your adjustments</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Side sleepers need special support, and this organic pillow delivers.</p><h3>Best organic pillow for stomach sleepers: <a href=# rel=nofollow>SOL Organics Down Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organic pillow for stomach sleepers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>SOL Organics Down Pillow</h3></p><p>The <a href=# rel=alternate>best pillows for stomach sleepers</a> are soft (not too firm) and on the thinner side—since a lofty pillow can put pressure on the neck. Undue pressure on the neck and spine equals neck and back pain, which can mean less restful sleep—if you’ve ever tried to doze off with a stiff neck, you know the struggle! This soft down version from SOL Organics is thin without being pancake thin, and the hypoallergenic down fill is plush and bouncy. (Stomach sleepers: For even more advice, see our guide for further suggestions for the <a href=# rel=alternate>best pillows for neck pain</a>.)</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Canadian white down</li><li>Cover: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Soft</li><li>Sizes: Standard, king</li><li>Trial: 30 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $147 - $176</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Soft down fill stays plush without falling flat</li><li>Free shipping</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some sleepers might prefer a down alternative</li><li>Not machine washable</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>You don’t have to stop sleeping on your stomach to find a great organic pillow, and this one proves it.</p><h3>Best organic pillow for back sleepers: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Saatva Latex Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organic pillow for back sleepers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Saatva Latex Pillow</h3></p><p>Back sleepers are the Goldilocks of the pillow shopping world, as they’re best supported by a pillow that is somewhere between soft and firm. It’s key to find a pillow that occupies that just-right sleep spot. This Saatva pillow comes in two heights, and the shredded latex core is adjustable, so you can add and subtract as needed. It’s like a custom-made pillow, only with a 45-night trial period and generous shipping! Saatva’s customer-friendly shopping experience is why they made our lists of the <a href=# rel=alternate>best places to buy bedding</a> and the <a href=# rel=alternate>best places to buy mattresses</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Natural latex</li><li>Cover: Organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Firm</li><li>Sizes: Standard, king</li><li>Trial: 45 days</li><li>Price on publish: $165 - $185</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Adjustable and several sizes make it feel like a custom-made product</li><li>Saatva also makes great mattresses for a one-stop shopping moment</li><li>Generous trial period</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Higher price point</li><li>People with latex allergies should skip this one</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An adjustable organic pillow that will help back sleepers stay in position all night long.</p><h3>Best cooling organic pillow: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Birch Organic Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best cooling organic pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Birch Organic Pillow</h3></p><p>As a hot sleeper, I’m used to doing the middle-of-the-night switch—waking up warm and flipping my pillow over, hoping for a bit of relief from the cooler side. This pillow from Birch might be the solution to my problem: The Talalay latex core is wrapped in wool that wicks away moisture and lets the pillow breathe, meaning it stays cool from the inside out. The latex and wool are then covered in GOTS- and Fair Trade-certified organic cotton, making for a pillow that promotes easy sleep on even the hottest nights of summer.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Talalay latex</li><li>Cover: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Medium</li><li>Sizes: Standard, king</li><li>Trial: 100 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $148 - $173.80, frequently marked down</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>In addition to the lengthy sleep trial, the brand also includes a one-year warranty</li><li>Cools from the inside out, rather than relying on a cooling cover</li><li>Brand runs frequent sales</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Might be too soft for some sleepers</li><li>People with latex and wool sensitivities might want to skip this one</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Run hot?

Both the cotton cover and the latex fill are organic, and the zippered case (ingenious!) makes adjusting the fill level and doing laundry a cinch. I love that the brand includes an extra bag of fill, and I really love that they offer a soft version for sleepers who want more gentle support.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Organic latex</li><li>Cover: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Soft, medium options available</li><li>Sizes: Standard, queen, king</li><li>Trial: 100 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $119 - $159</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Fast, free shipping and easy return process</li><li>Comes in three sizes</li><li>Soft version is soft and supportive at the same time</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>If you’re unsure what kind of pillow you want, there might be too many choices with this one</li><li>Website isn’t the easiest to navigate</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An organic pillow that truly feels like sleeping on a cloud.</p><h3>Best firm organic pillow: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Buffy Cloud Pillow in Firm</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best firm organic pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Buffy Cloud Pillow in Firm</h3></p><p>For people with necks prone to feeling stiff and shoulders prone to feeling tight, a firm pillow can be just the ticket, since it helps support healthy sleep positions and won’t deflate throughout the night. The exterior of Buffy’s Cloud is made from woven eucalyptus fabric, and the fill is made from recycled materials. A huge bonus here is the price—at $50, this is one of the most affordable pillows on our list.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: 100% GRS-certified, BPA-free, recycled PET fill</li><li>Cover: TENCEL lyocell shell</li><li>Firmness level: Firm</li><li>Sizes: Standard, king</li><li>Trial: 7 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $50 - $75</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>A mix of organic and recycled materials for maximum sustainability</li><li>Great price point</li><li>Fill stays plush throughout the night</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Short trial period</li><li>Doesn’t have a removable cover</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A firm pillow made with organic and recycled materials, at an accessible price point.</p><h3>Best luxury organic pillow: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Avocado Organic Luxury Plush Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best luxury organic pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Avocado Organic Luxury Plush Pillow</h3></p><p>Avocado uses luxe materials to make this pillow—think natural Talalay latex, followed by layers of wool, silk, and mohair. The goal was to create a pillow that supports heads, necks, and shoulders equally, and to feel incredibly bouncy and plush while doing it. Based on the reviews, it seems they nailed it. Avocado’s sustainability bona fides are impressive, too—as a company, they’re carbon-negative and zero-waste, with every part of this pillow coming with extensive organic certifications.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Talalay latex</li><li>Cover: GOTS-certified organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Medium</li><li>Sizes: Queen, king</li><li>Trial: 100 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $229 - $249</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Each part of the pillow is made from thoroughly-vetted organic materials</li><li>Medium firmness will work for a variety of sleep positions</li><li>Luxurious fabrics</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>One of the most expensive picks on our list</li><li>For down and down-style lovers, this might be too firm</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An organic pillow that feels seriously luxe.</p><h3>Best organic down pillow: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Company Store Organic Down Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organic down pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>The Company Store Organic Down Pillow</h3></p><p>There’s a reason down has been one of the most popular pillow fill materials since the invention of pillows—it’s soft, it’s cozy, and it feels like sleeping on a cloud. While down pillows are usually thought of as soft, this one comes in four different styles, ranging from soft to extra firm, making it an ideal pick for sleepers who love the idea of down, but need a little extra support. Since The Company Store runs frequent sales, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to snag it at a discount, too.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: European 600-fill power down</li><li>Cover: Organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Soft, medium, firm, extra-firm</li><li>Sizes: Standard, queen, king</li><li>Trial: N/A, but takes returns within 30 days</li><li>Price on publish: $118 - $251, depending on size and style</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>A versatile down option</li><li>Certifications ensure the down in these pillows comes from geese and ducks treated humanely</li><li>Discount codes and sales are frequent</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not vegan-friendly</li><li>Dry-clean only</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Down has been a popular pillow fill material for centuries–this one takes a classic and makes it sustainable.</p><h3>Best organic pillow for kids: <a href=# rel=nofollow>5 Little Monkeys Kids Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best organic pillow for kids</span></p><p><h3 class=title>5 Little Monkeys Kids Pillow</h3></p><p>5 Little Monkeys was founded by parents who, when their little ones were ready to transition out of the crib and into their own beds, noticed a lack of bedding designed with kids in mind. This pillow was made specially for kids, with a fill level meant to keep growing spines aligned correctly. Parents will love that it’s made of entirely organic materials, and they’ll really love that when laundry day rolls around, you can toss the whole pillow directly into the washing machine.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Not listed</li><li>Cover: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Firmness level: Medium</li><li>Sizes: Standard</li><li>Trial: 100 nights</li><li>Price on publish: $89</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Made with the needs of kids in mind</li><li>Machine washable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Price point is high for something little ones might outgrow quickly</li><li>Brand copy doesn’t offer much information about fill material</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Kids love organics, too, and they’ll certainly love this pillow.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-organic-pillows>How we selected the best organic pillows</h2><p>For this list, we combed brand and department store websites carefully. From there, we consulted with a sleep expert about sleep styles and needs and with bedding experts on the wide variety of organic certifications you can use to guide you as you shop for organic products.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-organic-pillows>What to consider when buying organic pillows</h2><h3>Sleep position</h3><p>Organic pillows come in various shapes and sizes, just like non-organic pillows. Look for phrases like side sleeper, stomach sleeper, and combination sleeper in both the copy and the reviews to determine which kind of organic pillow will suit you best.</p><h3>Organic certifications</h3><p>How organic do you want your organic pillow to be? Are you interested in focusing on organic materials, or are carbon-neutral shipping and fair-trade wages also something you want to consider? Look for labels like GOTS-certified and OKEO-Tex certified as you shop.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Organic doesn’t have to mean more expensive! Set a budget and then look for organic pillows that fit within that budget—and don’t forget to take advantage of coupon codes and seasonal sales. See our guide to the <a href=# rel=alternate>best places to buy pillows</a> for more.</p><h2 id=what-types-of-organic-pillows-are-available>What types of organic pillows are available?</h2><p>What’s great about organic pillows is that you can find a material and style you love no matter what you’re looking for—this list has everything from down to latex, cotton to wool, and extra-firm to extra-soft options.</p><h2 id=what-organic-certifications-are-there>What organic certifications are there?</h2><p>The two big certifications to look for are GOTS and OEKO-TEX. GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) verifies organic fiber cultivation, eco-friendly processing, and fair labor practices, while OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certifies that textiles are free from harmful chemicals. Some brands eschew certifications but still use organic materials.</p><h2 id=what-toxins-are-in-pillows>What “toxins” are in pillows?</h2><p>While “toxins” is a nebulous term at best, it’s true that some conventional pillows could be produced using synthetic materials and chemical treatments—like flame retardants, pesticides, and formaldehyde—none of which are things you want to breathe in all night. OEKO-Tex Standard 100 certification can give you peace of mind that a pillow is free from the top controversial chemical treatments.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is an organic pillow?</h3><p>An organic pillow is one that uses organic materials for both fill and cover, and might also be made from recycled, sustainable materials sourced and produced ethically.</p><h3>Who should use an organic pillow?</h3><p>If you’re interested in switching from non-organic to organic household items, pillows and bedding can be a great place to start. Organic pillows, since they come in all the same sizes and materials as their non-organic counterparts, are an easy swap for anyone looking to be more sustainable.</p><h3>How long do organic pillows last?</h3><p>The lifespan of an organic pillow is generally around two years, though that will depend on how often you’re sleeping on it! Generally, once your pillow gets flat or lumpy, it’s time for a new one.</p><h3>How do I clean an organic pillow?</h3><p>This depends on the material, both inside and outside. Some organic pillows come with zippable covers you can throw in the washing machine, while others—usually those filled with down, a more delicate material—need to be spot-cleaned or dry cleaned. Each of the organic pillows on this list includes care instructions to help simplify the process. Remember, taking care of your pillow means it lasts longer–check out our guide to <a href=# rel=alternate>how often you should replace pillows</a> for more.</p><h3>How do I know my pillow is truly organic?</h3><p>This is where certifications come in, such as GOTS and OEKO-TEX Standard 100, mentioned above.
