<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>My background is in banking and finance. I am a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria. I began my career in Banking over 25 years ago. During my two and half decades of professional stint in the industry, I have established and made a notable positive impact with monumental track records. I enjoy travelling around the world. At a dinner event in Buckingham Palace in the UK, an opportunity afforded me to meet a friend who introduced me to a highly connected individual. I have always helped this friend of mine with tips on articles related to fiscal and monetary policies. When people discuss difficult finance issues, I have always provided creative ideas and possible solutions that help resolve their challenges and concerns.</p><p>The individual I met was the High Commissioner of Grenada to the United Kingdom. We had some strategic discussions that led to her asking if I could help implement the ideas. She inquired: "Can you do this in my country?" This question piqued my interest. Following the occasion, I was invited to Grenada. Upon arrival, I noticed the various opportunities and benefits for Nigerians instead of the “Japa” trend by leveraging Grenada’s tremendous resources and fostering cross-cultural exchange by bringing in new ideas and innovations Nigerians could explore Grenada and bring back valuable experiences to Nigeria. This has been my mission for the past two years.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-cf0d424d-908e-4aaa-afd1-214dd06abcf9 data-caption="Abidemi Oluwagbenga Sonoiki (FCIB), the Honorary Consul of the Honorary Consulate of Grenada in Nigeria"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/nhQktkpTURBXy81OTc4OGUwYjY3YzBmMGVlZjExNmM3ZmZmN2M5MTQxNC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBMzCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>1) It’s interesting you already started with the background and now I would like you to share with us how you got to become the Honorary Consul of the Consulate of Grenada and what your role entails.</strong></p><p>I went to Grenada and handed over my resume and personal profile for deliberation. All required paperwork and interviews were completed, including international security checks, as part of the due diligence and background check to ensure there were no criminal histories or records. It was an election period, two months after the new Government assumed power, I was contacted and invited to Grenada by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Trade and Investment for another thorough evaluation. The new Prime Minister was gracious and directed the confirmation of my appointment as The Honorary Consul, effective immediately.</p><p>I received my letter of appointment afterwards and, then, the journey began. Naturally, once you are appointed by a country to another country, you will need to align with your host country, which includes involving the Presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The accreditation and processes took a while. It has been a journey of two years so far.</p><p>My duty and responsibility are to serve as the intermediary between Grenada and Nigeria. There is a need for us to harness all the talents and skills of the people of the two nations together. My topmost priority is to promote investment and trade, and to foster collaboration in areas such as education, health, tourism, culture, cross-cultural interactions, ideas and talent sharing, waste management and other critical areas. The consulate also delivers consular services to all Nigerians desiring travelling for business, education and leisure. This includes Nigerians pursuing pathways for citizenship by enhancing seamless trade capacity and abundant investment opportunities. We also provide first-hand information for enquiries, so that people do not get defrauded by anyone or agency.</p><p><strong>2) What are some of those key initiatives that are in place to strengthen the relationship between Nigeria and Grenada?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The first thing when you get such a mandate is to find like minds and identify skilled people, knowledgeable individuals in economy, investment and trade experts by bringing them together. We have been able to do that. Now, we are putting together the Nigeria-Grenada Chamber of Commerce. That is the engine that would help bring all the business people together from the North, South, East and West regions of Nigeria. There was nothing like that before now. We are also doing some exchange where our people will go there, some of them have been here. In April 2024, we hosted some investors from Grenada. They were in Abuja and Lagos. We spoke to them and they took back some ideas that they are working on. We are also planning a direct flight for some Nigerian businessmen and women in October 2024. This exhibition would showcase Nigerian small and medium enterprises and afford them collaborations in their various areas of interest.</p><p><strong>3) In the next five years, how do you see the relationship between Nigeria and Grenada?</strong></p><p>I want to witness a successful partnership. A partnership that will enable or afford Nigerians to make Grenada their second home and for Grenadians to make Nigeria their second home. The world has become a global market space and Nigerians who are doing business there can earn foreign exchange. We need all those foreign currencies to come to Nigeria.</p><p>Nigerians are exceptionally gifted. Before my appointment, over 150 Nigerians used to travel to Grenada to study medicine. Grenada has an excellent medical college. The numbers have increased to more than 250 in the last two years. We are considering the potential of increasing it to 500 because the medical systems in America and Canada absolve roughly 1,000 doctors from this college. Is it not lovely to witness Nigerians handling matters and returning money to their country? I see huge opportunities in the areas of travel and tourism, real estate investment and renewable energy. This synergy can earn us a remarkable amount of foreign exchange yield.</p><p><strong>4) One of the major challenges in getting to Grenada from Nigeria is a lack of an air transport system. What are the plans to solve this issue?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Two potential airline partnerships are currently under development, with ongoing discussions and negotiations taking place to bring these opportunities to fruition. One of the biggest airlines in Nigeria is almost concluding discussions with the Caricom State (Caribbean Community). We are also working on a wet lease arrangement for a direct flight from Nigeria to Grenada. This will enable Nigerians and Africans to fly directly from here to Grenada in under 10 hours once everything is ready. The norm is that you will either need to travel to the United Kingdom for six or seven hours, then a layover for another four (4) hours or three (3) hours before travelling finally for eight hours or more to the destination in Grenada. Similarly, if you choose to travel via the USA as well, you will need to travel to Atlanta or New York and then to Miami, which will take 16 to 21 hours to the Island of Grenada.</p><p>We're bringing in financial partners (investors) to resolve this challenge because I have witnessed all these obstacles. We are very definite of the possibilities of direct flight in the next 6 to 9 months.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9204c8e9-1477-480f-8a52-fe07ff5a84cd data-caption="Abidemi Oluwagbenga Sonoiki (FCIB) and team"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/6KHktkpTURBXy81MGYxY2RhNzY3ZjI4MTMxZTljOWVlMjIyNDQ5NGEwOC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p><strong>5) Can you please speak on the opportunities in the finance sector that you think Nigerians can benefit from?</strong></p><p>Currently, we are in conversation with a Finnish firm that is prepared to provide Nigerians and Grenadians capital to enable investments there. There are numerous small and medium-sized business opportunities. Ranging from service delivery like the Go-kada service delivery system, Nigerians can afford franchises of some global fast-food outlets and take them there through a business visa instead of the popular “Japa” route. The first mover advantage can possibly earn us some foreign investment yield. It will afford young enterprising Nigerians and Grenadians the synergy and symbiotic relationship.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>6) Can you tell us more about the strategic importance of Grenada in the Caribbean region and its global influence?</strong></p><p>Grenada is the pride of the Caribbean. I am not saying this because I am representing them. Honestly, if you take a one-week holiday there, you would not want to come back - although they need our collaboration given our business ideas and skills.</p><p>Grenada serves as a gateway to both North and South America, including countries such as the United States and Canada. Grenadians have direct access to the United Kingdom and are treated as citizens there. The island is an active member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and plays a pivotal role in regional economic and security initiatives. The current Prime Minister of Grenada is the one championing the development that is going on in the Caribbean. Globally, Grenada has established strong diplomatic and trade partnerships, contributing to its growing influence on the international stage. It is a very peaceful country that just needs more of the fintech and banking investments and things will improve the more.</p><p>In the next five years, the Prime Minister of Grenada and the Nigerian President will be the people who will be globally applauded for championing development across the globe. The opportunities for investment and trade in Grenada are in abundance beyond human eyes.</p><p><strong>7) Grenada is known for Tourism and a rich culture. What is your plan to build tourism relations between Grenada and Nigeria?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nigerians are wealthy individuals in their own right. Tourism plays a crucial role in defining leisure time. I have visited Grenada many times and upon each visit, I have found that there is not enough housing. Short-lets (Airbnb), hotels, and other accommodations are in short supply. There are huge opportunities for wealth creation in the real estate space. Reservations must be made in advance. Thus, if Nigerians can diversify their risks and see the potential, they get to earn a lot of money. You can conduct your business in Nigeria and also expand it to Grenada. We know places in Grenada where you can develop real estate, which is one of the major industries there. Nigerians can make a ton of foreign exchange via real estate.</p><p>Medical tourism is another area that is also viable in terms of investments. Nigerian physicians are excellent and renowned, and we can forge collaboration and partnership between both countries in the medical field. Waste management and renewal energy are among the few interests we can also explore.</p><p><strong>8) What are the benefits of obtaining a Grenadian citizenship? And then in this age of “Japa”, why do you think Nigerian youths should ditch countries like the UK, and Canada and opt for Grenada?</strong></p><p>Speaking of citizenship, if you want to be a citizen of America or Canada, you may need to be there physically for the next three to five years to acquire such privilege. You do not need to do that with Grenada, whose passport affords you access and visa-free movement to about 150 destinations. You can become a global citizen through Grenada in less than six months, although the country will undertake very thorough international checks and processes.</p><p>Your access to London, Paris, Switzerland, Russia, and China will become a delight and pride. You may also enjoy as much as 10 years of visa access to both America and Canada. Why would you want to be subjected to humiliation and unwarranted hardship in another country when you can enjoy the privileges in Grenada, the Pride of the Caribbean?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If you choose to visit Grenada to explore and experience first-hand, we will be delighted to issue appropriate entry visas before determining your next step of action.</p><p>Young talented and enterprising Nigerians can take advantage of the small business opportunities, creating sustainable wealth and preserving the same for their effort and sweat.</p><p><strong>9) Can you pinpoint specific education opportunities in Grenada?</strong></p><p>St. George’s University in Grenada is a renowned medical college of repute from where Canada and America select over 1,000 medical doctors from year to year. We can assist Nigerian students who want to become a medical student at St. George’s University in Grenada. The Honorary Consulate of Grenada is always willing and ready to be of assistance to all Africans desirous of this journey. You can stay, work, and live there and still find yourself back to Nigeria, your home.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5a4a20d3-494b-453b-96e5-0fbca8142a35 data-caption="Abidemi Oluwagbenga Sonoiki (FCIB), the Honorary Consul of the Honorary Consulate of Grenada in Nigeria"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/eWnktkpTURBXy9hNDI5MTY5N2QwMGMzZGZlYzVjODc5NjUwMmNiYTZkOC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAkzCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>10) On trade, what is the trade relation between Nigeria and Grenada and can you put a value to it?</strong></p><p>If you go on the internet, you will see the level of trade between Nigeria and Grenada over the years. You will also see the paradigm shift in the trade volume in the two years. We are putting effort together to enhance collaboration in export between both countries and the rest of the world. I want a situation where an exporter of spices in Nigeria can increase their volume of trade to Canada, America and Europe through a continuum and synergy of both countries, thereby making them aggregators for the sales and distribution of commodities. You are not just a Nigerian exporter; you are also exporting from your partners in Grenada.</p><p><strong>#FeatureByAustinCharles</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtfmbyusdKtoJxno6S7sLXKomSupqaatq2%2FjKyrq5mkmrSqr4yipaKsmZbBqsLErGSfp6Jiu6qzxKugmmWXp7KvrcOaZK2qkZmybrXNr5ysrJ2au7V7j2qqp2%2BoqA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsonoiki-unveils-strategic-initiatives-for-nigeria-grenada-trade-investment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsonoiki-unveils-strategic-initiatives-for-nigeria-grenada-trade-investment.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsonoiki-unveils-strategic-initiatives-for-nigeria-grenada-trade-investment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsonoiki-unveils-strategic-initiatives-for-nigeria-grenada-trade-investment.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsonoiki-unveils-strategic-initiatives-for-nigeria-grenada-trade-investment.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsonoiki-unveils-strategic-initiatives-for-nigeria-grenada-trade-investment.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wilfredo-de-jesus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wilfredo-de-jesus.html>The 2013 TIME 100</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pour-la-region-centre-le-numerique-dans-les-lycees-necessite-moyens-et-enseignants.html>Pour la rgion Centre, le numrique dans les lyces ncessite moyens et enseignants</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pour-la-region-centre-le-numerique-dans-les-lycees-necessite-moyens-et-enseignants.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
