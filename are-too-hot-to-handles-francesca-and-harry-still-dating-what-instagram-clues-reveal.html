<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Please allow me to present my case based on clues from their Instagram accounts (which, first off, follow each other):</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-3>1. Harry visited Francesca's hometown last summer.</h3></p><p>Remember how Francesca told Harry he'd like Vancouver once he visited it? Well, according to the Australian's Instagram, he just so happened to be hanging out in her city during June and August 2019. Not only that, but from the looks of one Instagram photo, he certainly seems to have enjoyed his stay.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While Francesca isn't in any of the photos (because that'd spoil the show, duh), one of Harry's Vancouver pics were taken while sitting in a lime green Lamborghini.</p><p>You know who else has a pic of themselves in front of a lime green Lamborghini? Francesca.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Though she geotagged the photo in Las Vegas, the car very obviously has a Vancouver, British Columbia front license plate. So... you be the judge here.</p><p>Corresponding car pics aside, I find it pretty hard to believe that Harry would travel halfway around the world to the exact place his beau lives if it wasn't for the express reason of seeing her.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>2. Francesca also traveled to Australia, where Harry lives.</h3></p><p>Coincidence? I think not. Of all the vegemite joints in all the world, she walked into hisbecause (I am convinced) Francesca wanted some QT with her cutie. After all, do you know anyone who takes a 16-plus-hours-long flight to the exact place their ex-boyfriend lives? I don't.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Granted, Francesca does have a knack for revenge schemes, but even so, it's kinda hard to believe that anyone would drop thousands of dollars on plane tickets, lodging, etc. just to get back at an ex.</p><p>Not to mention, she and Harry both posted photos with kangaroos from what appears to be the same wildlife sanctuary on THE EXACT SAME DAY.</p><p>Harry geotagged <a href=# id=5d850a38-2783-3db9-a1f3-bec77f554207>Cooberrie Park Wildlife Sanctuary</a> , while Francesca simply tagged Gold Coast, Queensland. Well, ya know where the wildlife sanctuary is located, according to their website? That's right: Yeppoon, Capricorn Coast in Queensland, which also happens to be exactly where Francesca geotagged a bikini pic posted to Instagram one day earlier.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>3. They both have L.A. as a second location in their Instagram bios.</h3></p><p>Besides their trips to see each other, it seems that both Francesca and Harry split their time between their hometowns and Los Angeles. This tidbit isn't too earth-shattering, since they're already both Instagram models and, now, reality TV personalities. Not to mention, L.A. is the obvious place you move to after becoming famous (see: every notable member of Bachelor Nation ever), buuuuuut it's still a clue that they're together.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At the very least, they must've been chill with hanging in the same city until Francesca's last L.A. post shared in November 2019. Now, based on her most recent posts, she's self-quarantining in Vancouver amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But, to that end, why would she still have L.A. in her Instagram bio if she wasn't planning to live there permanently (and potentially with her love, Harry)?</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-26>4. They've legit commented on each other's Instagrams.</h3></p><p>And not just their most recent Too Hot To Handle posts. Remember that kiss pic taken in Vancouver? Yeah, Harry straight-up tagged Francesca in the comments.</p><p>All he wrote was "you," but that pretty much implies those were her lips that left the kiss mark on his cheek. Not only that, but Francesca liked the comment, along with two of Harry's friends (who Francesca has interacted with on Instagrammore on that later).</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="harry jowsey instagram"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/0nbktkuTURBXy85ZTBhMDRlYS1kMTllLTQ5MzUtOGQxNy1jYjBlMGM3MjZiMmEuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0Cj8LD></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>To add fuel to this hypothetically hot AF fire, when a fan asked Harry "who's the lucky girl?" he responded, "top secret." And when another commented, "Who's is [sic] your secret girl Harry we want to know," he said, "soon, I promise."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2083cba7-1fe4-4525-9f00-254c46864838 data-caption="harry jowsey instagram"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/y6xktkuTURBXy83MjU2ZGJlYS02ZTA3LTRhN2UtYmU5OS02NGQxMGEwYjIwYjAuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0B-MLD></span><p>And when still another Instagram follower commented, "We need some travel videos Harry let's go," he said: "I have banked up will drop them all when we are allowed."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-bacf87e6-ee4c-4390-9515-677bfe8a07c4 data-caption="harry jowsey instagram"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/KIKktkuTURBXy85YTE4MTQwMC0zZWI5LTRhMWMtYjQyZC00NGNjYzQ2NzUxZDUuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0B_sLD></span><p>Hmmm... when "we" are allowed? Let's be real, that has to be a reference to his and Francesca's Netflix contracts forcing them to keep all evidence of their relationship on the DL until after the show premieres. (Remember how <a href=# id=433e8b72-79e9-307f-a0f6-a9e8bc4d7b04>Love Is Blind's Amber and Barnett</a> shared a ton of #secretyearoffun couples photos only after the reunion premiered? These two are likely in the same situation.)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-35>5. But they did also post about being single on Valentine's Day.</h3></p><p>For starters, Harry's caption reads, "As Valentines Day approaches its a good time to think about relationships and how its two people coming together to solve problems you wouldnt have if you were just single ." But, as if that weren't clear enough, he also wrote "Staying single forever" in the comments.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-0611bfce-3437-4e06-a4f0-a0fa63eb70c1 data-caption="harry jowsey instagram"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/0bpktkuTURBXy81OTUyMTZjMC0zNDc4LTQ0NDAtYjM0ZS1jZmFmNzgxOGJmMzQuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0BVsLD></span><p>Meanwhile, in a post geotagged at "Single Island" (which, lol), Francesca wrote in the caption, "happy V day to everyone getting drunk w their friends tonight & NOT texting their exs ;)."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, their summer lovin' could've ended by February, or these posts could just be an elaborate ruse to throw social media sleuths (@me) off their tracks. Still, neither Harry nor Francesca liked each other's V Day posts, which does make it seem like some kind of breakup actually did go down.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-42>6. And they're not quarantining together now.</h3></p><p>Based on Harry and Francesca's latest Instagram posts, he's holed up in L.A., while she's staying at home in Vancouver amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And neither of them have liked each other's quaratine pictures either... whomp whomp. (Maybe they're just busy preparing themselves for reality TV fame? Idk.)</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-47>7. But Francesca told Harry's friend she wants them to be.</h3></p><p>And this, my friends, is why you always, always, always check the comments. That's where the juiciest stuff is hiding.</p><p>Two Instagram users/friends of Harry, Kristian Barbarich ( <a href=# id=664edda5-884c-39cc-a42f-b851246e0cee>@kristianbarbarich</a> ) and Jacob Botica ( <a href=# id=dcee64d8-43b2-392a-a188-5e2739e7ead1>@jacobbotica</a> ) tagged Harry in the comments on Francesca's post from April 9.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-09225dfa-3a3f-4450-ada0-3c7cc08301f5 data-caption="francesca farago instagram comments"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/GaTktkuTURBXy9jNmE5NDhhOC0yYTc4LTQ5MmMtOTRjZC0zNjkwMzViNTYyMjUuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0B08LD></span><p>But that's not all, in response to @jacobbotica, Francesca wrote, "hi can we all quarantine together?" He responded, "pls" with the puppy dog eyes emoji.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b556ee2a-491d-4429-b7a0-b0a208d836ba data-caption="francesca farago instagram"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/DfaktkuTURBXy8yZmNjZDMyMC0yNWI3LTRhNDMtODk0Yi04NWZhYmEwZWMzZWYuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0DlMLD></span><p>Now, who in their right mind would want to quarantine with their ex-boyfriend and two besties amid a global pandemic?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Okay, so former <a href=# id=4f0605cf-0c4d-3176-afb2-029cf7386ff1>Bachelorette Hannah Brown did just that with Tyler Cameron</a> (they're almost definitely back together), but the very fact that it is Harry's friends starting these IG comment convos is pretty much undeniable proof that Harry and Francesca are still dating. Friends don't let friends comment on their ex-girlfriend's Instagrams, ya know?</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-57>8. Harry's friend joked about attending Francesca's wedding.</h3></p><p>Oh, and if all that wasn't enough to convince you. How about this comment from @jacobbotica on Francesca's most recent post.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He wrote, "Can't wait to be the flower girl at your wedding," which is obviously a joke because he's a grown man.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7ff27b48-ce30-44a1-8995-8feeb0997174 data-caption="francesca farago instagram"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3JlktkuTURBXy83MGY5ZTI2OC0yN2ExLTQ5Y2MtYmU0My01ODBmZjRjZjVlNGIuanBlZ5GVAs0C7s0BK8LD></span><p>But the fact that he's joking about attending Francesca's wedding at all? Why would he do that if said hypothetical wedding wouldn't (one day) involve one of his best friends? He wouldn't.</p><p>I rest my damn case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOmqmeZaSkvG60zq1kraddna6vsMueqmaeopa7pLHSnJhmmZ6Zeqmt0auwZquknrmtecOaq6Kml2LEqa3TZqCnq6SWtLOtzGaapa2VqHqzsdWemKVnaaOArLeVoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-too-hot-to-handles-francesca-and-harry-still-dating-what-instagram-clues-reveal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-too-hot-to-handles-francesca-and-harry-still-dating-what-instagram-clues-reveal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-too-hot-to-handles-francesca-and-harry-still-dating-what-instagram-clues-reveal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-too-hot-to-handles-francesca-and-harry-still-dating-what-instagram-clues-reveal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-too-hot-to-handles-francesca-and-harry-still-dating-what-instagram-clues-reveal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-too-hot-to-handles-francesca-and-harry-still-dating-what-instagram-clues-reveal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./can-whites-say-the-n-word.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./can-whites-say-the-n-word.html>Can Whites Say the N-Word?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./anne-of-green-gables.html>Anne of Green Gables: 100 Best YA Books of All Time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./anne-of-green-gables.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
