It lost more than 200,000 customers in just one weekend.</p><p>That was just a prelude to Uber's no-good, very bad year. Since February, when a blog post by a former engineer sparked a major investigation into the company's business and culture, Uber has been pummeled by a seemingly never-ending barrage of bad news.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The series of crises ultimately led to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's resignation on Tuesday amid an investor revolt. Here's everything that's happened to Uber since things took a turn for the worse with the engineer's post:</p><p>February 19: The beginning</p><p><strong>Susan Fowler starts it all with her reflections on "one very, very strange year at Uber." </strong>Fowler, a former engineer at the company, <a href=# id=d0c0bf02-bdce-5958-9ab8-5a66380808be>alleges in a blog post</a> that she was sexually harassed at Uber and experienced gender bias during her time at the company. She claims a manager propositioned her and asked for sex, but she says her complaints to Uber's human resources department were dismissed because the manager was a high performer. Uber continued to ignore her complaints, and her manager threatened to fire her for reporting things to HR, she says.</p><p><strong>Uber CEO Travis Kalanick immediately pledges to look into Fowler's allegations. </strong>Kalanick <a href=# id=a34cfbb0-ece1-5c66-a560-667ef9c3424c>responds within hours</a> of the post's publication to say that what Fowler said she experienced was "abhorrent & against everything we believe in." Uber hires Eric Holder, a former US attorney general, to lead an independent investigation into its workplace culture.</p><p><strong>A few days later, the </strong><a href=# id=16b448f0-ac66-580d-89e3-609691aadc21>New York Times publishes a bombshell report</a><strong> that suggests Fowler's claims were not isolated.</strong> Employees did cocaine during a company retreat and a manager had to be fired after groping multiple women, according to the report. Former employees tell the Times they notified Uber's leadership, including Kalanick and CTO Thuan Pham, about workplace harassment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>February 23: Investor betrayal and accusations of stolen technology</p><p><strong>Uber investors Freada and Mitch Kapor blast the company for failing to change. </strong>In <a href=# id=b6742f11-2240-5902-b7fa-84b88c1dcbd1>an open letter to Uber's investors and board</a>, the Kapors <a href=# id=57c16b3e-c4aa-58b2-87f2-b48aa3f9c98f>say Uber has ignored</a> their years long behind-the-scenes efforts to positively influence the company's culture. "We are speaking up now because we are disappointed and frustrated; we feel we have hit a dead end in trying to influence the company quietly from the inside," the Kapors write.</p><p><strong>Waymo, the spinout of Google, another Uber investor, sues the ride-hailing company for intellectual property theft.</strong> In <a href=# id=e67c8372-81c8-5774-9145-74b013b69f3b>an explosive lawsuit</a>, Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving-car division, accuses Uber of using stolen technology to advance its own autonomous-car development. Filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, the <a href=# id=678e9922-b30d-5426-81f7-cf72b625317c>suit</a> claims a team of ex-Google engineers stole Waymo's design for the laser sensor that allows self-driving cars to map the environment around them.</p><p>February 27: A high-profile exec is out under a cloud of controversy</p><p><strong>Uber's senior vice president of engineering steps down amid allegations of sexual-harassment at his previous job.</strong> Recode's Kara Swisher <a href=# id=4108740e-e1c9-5f70-89c3-6972054b7fc7>notifies the company of the allegations</a> against the engineer, Amit Singhal, while reporting a story. When Uber CEO Travis Kalanick find out about them, <a href=# id=579133b5-52e3-5b55-971e-a1c2449fa35f>he asks Singhal to resign</a>. Singhal, who passed Uber's standard background checks before joining the company, strenuously denies the allegations.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>February 28: Kalanick loses his cool</p><p><strong>A dashcam video catches Uber's CEO in a heated argument over prices. </strong>Bloomberg publishes a video <a href=# id=24cb4bcc-5c8d-5d86-bce4-a5cc74d6351b>showing Kalanick losing his cool</a> in an argument with an Uber driver after the driver confronted him about reduced fares.</p><p><strong>Kalanick issues a "profound" apology and says he'll seek leadership help.</strong> "My job as your leader is to leadâ€¦and that starts with behaving in a way that makes us all proud," <a href=# id=1ce92c64-ee0d-5276-8b4b-98756019d86e>he writes in his apology</a> note. "That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away. This is the first time I've been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it."</p><p>March 3: 'Greyballs' and another executive resignation</p><p><strong>The New York Times reveals Uber has been secretly deceiving authorities for years with a tool called 'Greyball'. </strong>Uber used the tool to evade authorities, particularly at times when city regulators were trying to block the ride-hailing service, according to a report by <a href=# id=9a8c73ef-dcaf-59ca-8294-6406a8d94d80>The Times' Mike Isaac</a>. The <a href=# id=41d2fb83-06aa-55a7-9be8-0bc59f81207e>tool collected data</a> from Uber's app to identify and evade officials in cities like Boston, Paris, and Las Vegas. The Times reports that the program was used in markets where Uber was banned or being resisted by law enforcement.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Uber loses another top official. </strong>Uber's vice president of product and growth, Ed Baker, <a href=# id=84370f94-b0e6-5861-bc77-9d4c548e2242>resigns suddenly</a> after more than three years at the company. In an email <a href=# id=6f75ba59-422a-5853-94d1-622c118c101f>obtained by Recode</a>, Baker says he wants to join the public sector. But Recode raises question about the timing of his departure, reporting that other employees had complained about his "questionable" behavior.</p><p>March 7: Uber is officially looking for a COO</p><p>March 8: Uber changes it mind about greyballing as the executive exodus continues</p><p><strong>Uber backtracks and changes its position on "Greyballing." </strong>After initially gleefully admitting it had used the controversial tool to target government officials, Uber <a href=# id=4219e428-274b-5968-8add-4eaf86677d45>reverses its position</a> and says it will no longer use it going forward.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>The executive exodus continues with Uber's head of artificial intelligence departing.</strong> Gary Marcus <a href=# id=c95ff467-27ec-5174-b21c-a5c42012ba4f>steps aside to become an "adviser"</a> to Uber, only four months after the ride-hailing company had acquired his AI startup, Geometric Intelligence.</p><p>March 19: Uber's president quits</p><p><strong>Uber suffers another black eye when its president abruptly quits the company.</strong></p><p><strong>Shortly after Jones' departure, word comes that another exec is also leaving. </strong>Brian McClendon, a vice president who led Uber's mapping teams, <a href=# id=ea5b0618-fc42-5608-973a-78a7384dc788>had already been planning to leave the company</a>. But the timing of the news isn't optimal, given the other recent departures. McClendon says he's heading back to Kansas where he wants to get into politics.</p><p>March 25: Travis Kalanick's visit to a Seoul escort-karaoke bar is revealed</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a href=# id=f2e0c137-2715-56b4-b6ef-9f9253128ce3>A bombshell report by The Information</a><strong> describes a 2014 visit by an Uber team to an escort-karaoke bar in Seoul.</strong><a href=# id=9b22f924-02fd-5f6c-acfd-a4b9304fdb35>According to the report</a>, "four male Uber managers picked women out of the group, calling out their numbers, and sat with them." After the evening, a female Uber employee told the company's HR department the trip made her uncomfortable, according to the report.</p><p><strong>Later, on the same day the report is published, an Uber SUV operating in autonomous mode is involved in an accident.</strong> Nobody is seriously injured, and a police spokesperson reportedly says Uber is not at fault. But <a href=# id=2962a23a-912a-5c07-aff2-419a848c1bb4>Uber tells Business Insider</a> it's halting its self-driving car pilot test in Arizona. It later restarts its self-driving car trials.</p><p>March 28: It hasn't been all bad, though. Uber's diversity report is better than expected.</p><p><strong>Uber releases its </strong><a href=# id=f5f92669-01b5-5270-8a22-a03987f474bb>diversity numbers</a><strong>. </strong>As part of its pledge to turn around the company, Uber releases its first diversity report. That's something Kalanick resisted for years, but the investigation into the company's work culture changes the CEO's mind.</p><p>April 11: Uber's communicator-in-chief calls it quits</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Rachel Whetstone, Uber's head of communications and policy, leaves the company. </strong>Whetstone, who joined Uber in 2015 after a long stint overseeing communications at Google, <a href=# id=bc7e6d34-b223-503f-8a92-4632dc35917f>had struggled to get Uber back on message</a> amid the repeated crises. Jill Hazelbaker, who previously reported to Whetstone, takes over for her.</p><p>April 17: And the bleed of senior leadership just won't stop</p><p><strong>Sherif Marakby, who helped start Uber's self-driving car program, leaves. </strong>Marakby's departure comes amid Uber's lawsuit with Waymo over autonomous car technology, but Uber says his job change is unrelated. After spending just a year with Uber, Marakby is now back at Ford <a href=# id=8405623d-91f7-5847-a624-ed0b85b399b6>to lead the car giant's self-driving car unit</a>.</p><p>April 23: It wasn't just "Greyball." Uber tried to deceive Apple, too</p><p><strong>A report reveals tension between Apple and Uber. </strong>After calling Kalanick to his office, Apple CEO Tim Cook had threatened to yank Uber's app from the iPhone maker's App Store, <a href=# id=c35febeb-0f95-5392-b754-0f55ea23bf3a>New York Times reports</a>. Cook accused Uber of violating the App Store's terms and conditions, according to the report.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Uber <a href=# id=c9996641-d17a-528d-a489-1138913dc029>had incorporated into its app a small piece of code</a> that could identify particular phones, even if after they had been wiped of their data. The ride-hailing company had included the code to prevent fraud, according to the report. The software allowed the company to detect if someone was using the same phone over and over again but wiping it repeatedly to take advantage of promo codes.</p><p>May 4: The U.S. Justice department opens a criminal investigation into Uber's use of 'Greyball'</p><p><strong>The U.S. Justice Department launches</strong><strong>a criminal probe into "Greyball."</strong> Authorities are looking into Uber's use of the tool, which helped its drivers evade transportation regulators who were looking to crack down on the ride-hailing service, <a href=# id=64e7d5c2-9391-5ab8-8759-219bc6b2c275>Reuters reports</a>. Uber had previously acknowledged using "Greyball", including against officials in cities like Portland, Oregon.</p><p>May 11: Uber's case with Waymo is put under a criminal microscope</p><p><strong>A judge denies Uber's bid to avoid a trial with Waymo and refers Uber's case to prosecutors. </strong>Judge William Alsup asks the US attorney to examine whether Uber may have broken the law and stolen technology to build self-driving cars, a stunning twist in the legal fight between the ride-hailing company and Waymo. Alsup also rules that Waymo can take its claims against Uber to trial, denying Uber's bid to move the case into private arbitration.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>May 15: A judge blocks Anthony Levandowski from working on self-driving cars.</p><p><strong>A federal judge bars an Uber self-driving car engineer from doing related work. </strong>The actions of Anthony Levandowski, who previously worked at Google, are at the heart of the ongoing legal dispute between Uber and Waymo. Judge William Alsup's order prohibits Levandowski from working on the lidar laser sensor technology used by autonomous cars to map their environment.</p><p>Uber had already preemptively <a href=# id=9c0a791f-ccf1-5663-b3b5-8d79a79c43e6>demoted Levandowski</a> from leading its self-driving-car project and had barred him from working on lidar technology.</p><p>May 18: Uber's longtime general counsel gets a promotion â€” but opens up another vacancy</p><p><strong>Uber's top lawyer takes a new job at the company. </strong>Salle Yoo <a href=# id=bfd54aa5-c8a3-56f4-a173-434e7c3ca095>is promoted </a>to chief legal officer after nearly five years at the company. In her new role, Yoo will work closely with Uber's HR chief, Liane Hornsey, on the company's upcoming cultural shift. But her move means Uber's general counsel post, which manages its day-to-day legal affairs, is open, giving the company <a href=# id=56257fe8-ec16-57ca-ad86-ff8fad256835>another key position it has to fill</a>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>May 23: Uber has to pay out millions after a bad accounting error</p><p><strong>Uber reveals an accounting mistake caused it to shortchange its drivers in New York City for years. </strong>Uber tells drivers in New York City it will repay them "tens of millions" of dollars after it took more than its share of the fares customers paid for rides.
