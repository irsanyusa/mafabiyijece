<time>19 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/spending.original.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>The number of Britons who say they can’t afford to have the Christmas they want has doubled since last year</h2><p>With presents to buy, socialising to do and food and drink to indulge in, the average Briton will spend £642 on Christmas this year – but many will face going into debt as a result.</p><p>People will spend hundreds on gifts, food, socialising and travel this festive season, with nearly four in ten (38%) anticipating turning to credit or borrowing to fund their Christmas spend.</p><p>According to YouGov’s annual Christmas spending tracker, the biggest expense for Britons this year will typically be on presents and gifts (a median figure of £300), followed by food and drink (£100) and socialising (£100).</p><p>Annual expenditure is largely unchanged compared to 2021, when the average person said they’d spend £670, though Britons say they’ll spend less on hotel stays this year — from a median figure of £70 to £42. (The overall expenditure figures for this year and last year are the sum of the median expected expenditures on each of the six categories; an earlier article based on last year’s survey arrived at a higher figure of total spend because it used the methodology of mean expenditures.)</p><h3>Stark rise in the number of Britons unable to afford the Christmas they want</h3><p>In the face of a pervasive cost of living crisis, more than four in ten people (42%) insist they’ll do whatever they can to have the Christmas they want this year.</p><p>But a quarter of Britons (25%) say they’re unable to have the celebration they’d like because they can’t afford it – twice as many as said the same in 2021 (12%).</p><h3>The cost of Christmas is not just counted in pounds and pence</h3><p>Most people (54%) agree that Christmas gets more difficult to afford every year, including 15% in strong agreement. That’s significantly up from the 36% who agreed last year.</p><p>And for many, the cost of Christmas takes its toll not just on the wallet, with 38% of Britons saying the cost makes the occasion “too stressful” (a rise from 27% last year) while 25% say they struggle to enjoy the occasion because they’re worried about how much they’re spending (up from 16% in 2021).</p><h3>An increasing number of Britons are struggling to pay their bills – and many expect to see debts increase over Christmas</h3><p>That Britons are feeling stressed about the cost of the festive season is perhaps unsurprising given more than half (54%) say they’re already falling behind or struggling to keep up with bills and credit commitments, up from 41% last year.</p><p>To ensure the impact of Christmas is not as stressful, 34% of people say they save throughout the year to afford gifts, while an additional 41% will dip into existing savings pots to pay for presents.</p><p>But 42% think they’ll spend more than they should this festive season, with many expecting to fall further into debt as a result.</p><p>More than one in five Britons (22%) expect their debts to increase over Christmas. That’s up from 14% who expected debts to increase because of Christmas last year.</p><p>Among those who are already financially distressed (those struggling to keep up with financial commitments or worried they’ll fall behind), the figure is higher at 37%, including 21% who say their level of debt will increase significantly.</p><p>And the majority (61%) of the 8% of Britons who are already over-indebted (those who have been three months or more behind on their bills/financial commitments in the past six months) believe their debt will worsen because of Christmas.</p><h3>One in 11 Britons will avoid paying off debts to fund Christmas</h3><p>Despite the likelihood of debts increasing over the festive season for many Britons, one in 11 (9%) say they’ll avoid paying all or some of their debts to fund Christmas.</p><p>And the proportion of people who say they’ll turn to credit or borrowing to afford presents and gifts has grown since last year, with 18% saying they’ll use credit cards (15% in 2021), 7% who’ll pay presents off with instalment schemes like Klarna or Clearpay (5%), 3% who’ll use store cards and 3% catalogue credit (2% and 2% respectively last year).</p><p>The proportion of Britons planning to take out payday loans has not changed, with 1% saying they’ll do so, the same amount as say they’ll borrow from friends or family (1%).</p><p>Looking at gift shopping specifically, the proportion of Britons who will use some form of borrowing or credit is highest among those already struggling financially.</p><p>Those who are financially distressed or over-indebted, for example, are far more likely to rely on instalment schemes at 12% and 24% respectively, compared to 7% of all Britons.</p><p>Generally, the biggest proportion of Britons say they’ll be funding their present buying with savings – 41% of all Britons say they will dip into existing savings pots while 34% have saved up specifically for Christmas.</p><p>This falls to 35% for those struggling with financial commitments or worried they’re going to fall behind and to 19% for those who have been three months behind or more on their bills in the last six months.</p><h3>Most Britons say cancelling Christmas is not an option</h3><p>Despite the impact of the cost of living crisis and the financial struggle many families are facing, nearly seven in ten people (68%) maintain cancelling Christmas is not an option for them, up from 60% last year.</p><p>A quarter of people (25%) say they’re normally cautious with their finances but will spend what they want at Christmas, with 26% of Britons saying it’s the only time of the year they treat their family to what they want.</p><p>And more than one in five Britons (22%) say Christmas is the time of year they stop worrying about their finances and focus on enjoying themselves instead, with a third (33%) saying seeing others enjoy the festivities is worth any added stress.</p><p class=postsid
