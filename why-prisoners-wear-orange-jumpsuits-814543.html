This is&nbsp;true, but it&nbsp;wasn’t always like this. Originally, prisoners in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US were wearing uniforms with black-and-white stripes.</p><p>In&nbsp;the early 20th century, things started to&nbsp;change. And switching these colors to&nbsp;something else was supposed to&nbsp;cut off the association with gangs. Orange jumpsuits appeared in&nbsp;the 70s.</p><p>Inmates don’t always wear them: only when being transported or&nbsp;going outside. Why? For higher visibility. Wearing striking orange, an&nbsp;inmate can’t get away and get lost in&nbsp;the crowd easily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a8e/196/025e5f54d08b8a0fb7f6b426ae.png><p>Okay, more uniforms. For example, astronauts always wear white, and there’s a&nbsp;good reason for&nbsp;it. Space isn’t the safest place, and temperatures are very extreme, going from melting hot to&nbsp;freezing cold. White is&nbsp;the color that reflects heat best, and it’s great for the spacesuit’s cooling and heating systems. And the last point&nbsp;— in&nbsp;the darkness of&nbsp;space, white is&nbsp;the most visible color, so&nbsp;that’s another bonus.</p><p>Okay, it&nbsp;makes sense, but then why don’t firefighters wear white to&nbsp;reflect heat? Well, when you’re surrounded by&nbsp;flames, the color of&nbsp;the uniform doesn’t make much difference. And the problem with white is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;gets covered in&nbsp;ash and dust, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t look white anymore. With black or&nbsp;brown, there’s no&nbsp;such problem, or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least it’s not so&nbsp;visible. Firefighters also have reflective stripes on&nbsp;their uniforms, which makes them more visible.</p><p>The next profession that comes to&nbsp;mind is&nbsp;police officers, and what color do&nbsp;they wear? Yes, dark blue. So, the first police department appeared at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 19th century in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=UK data-link=tag>UK</a>. The uniform was made blue so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was easy to&nbsp;distinguish between police officers and soldiers, who had already been wearing white and red by&nbsp;then.</p><p>When a&nbsp;police department was established in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;decades later, they followed the tradition. Interestingly, the uniform hue has never changed. Turns out, it’s a&nbsp;very practical color: you can’t see any stains on&nbsp;it. And it’s also very helpful because, at&nbsp;night, a&nbsp;police officer can track suspects down while staying unnoticed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/132/23e/3e22495b7287eac0cdcb1f6096.png><p>Medical workers usually wear uniforms that are a&nbsp;shade of&nbsp;blue or&nbsp;green. There’s a&nbsp;reason for&nbsp;it. Before the 20th century, medical staff was simply wearing their regular clothes, even when performing surgery. With the development of&nbsp;medicine, people started to&nbsp;pay more attention to&nbsp;how sterile everything was. So, they started to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;uniform.</p><p>At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;was white to&nbsp;signify purity. But the problem was that some stains were very hard to&nbsp;wash off from the white uniform. The color white turned greenish in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time. So, it&nbsp;made sense to&nbsp;make the uniform green and blue.</p><p>There’s another reason, too. Surgeons mostly focus on&nbsp;red colors during work. Blue and green are exactly on&nbsp;the opposite side of&nbsp;the spectrum. So, if&nbsp;everything else is&nbsp;greenish blue, red becomes even more distinctive.</p><p>Still, it’s a&nbsp;mistake to&nbsp;think that all of&nbsp;them wear the exact same color. In&nbsp;many hospitals, different departments are “color-coded,” you may say. I&nbsp;mean that different departments wear scrubs of&nbsp;different colors so&nbsp;that people and other doctors can easily understand who the person is&nbsp;and differentiate between nurses, surgeons, and physicians right away. It&nbsp;helps address the correct person with a&nbsp;specific request.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/284/ef7/d25fa2565c811b2d8b7372f7ab.png><p>The cutest detail about the doctors’ outfits, though, is&nbsp;probably the crocs. Why do&nbsp;they love this kind of&nbsp;footwear? Well, it&nbsp;turns out they’re the easiest to&nbsp;clean and sterilize. The foam they’re made of&nbsp;can be&nbsp;hand-washed or&nbsp;washed in&nbsp;the machine, and there will be&nbsp;no&nbsp;damage to&nbsp;the shoe whatsoever. Also, they’re obviously soft, comfy, and breathable, which makes them the best shoes for people who spend days standing.</p><p>Ever wondered why most doctors have sloppy handwriting? No, there’s no&nbsp;special class in&nbsp;medical colleges. The reason why it’s so&nbsp;common is&nbsp;that doctors are always in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush, and they write as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible. So, there’s no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;care about their writing style.</p><p>Also, keep in&nbsp;mind that you’re not the only person they write a&nbsp;prescription for that day. Doctors do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;paperwork, often for about 10&nbsp;hours straight, and they’re just too tired most of&nbsp;the time to&nbsp;deal with calligraphy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/682/eab/f08c0f51b089c899b48e043cd9.png><p>In&nbsp;most countries, <a href=# title="wedding dresses" data-link=tag>wedding dresses</a> are typically white, but this tradition isn’t as&nbsp;old as&nbsp;you might think. Until the 19th century, wedding dresses were any random color&nbsp;— basically, a&nbsp;bride just wore the best gown she owned. Often, they weren’t white. You see, back in&nbsp;the day, with no&nbsp;running water, white wasn’t a&nbsp;very practical color.</p><p>Female members of&nbsp;royal families typically got married wearing red gowns. In&nbsp;1840, Queen Victoria changed the tradition when she got married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;white gown. At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;was frowned upon because white was associated with mourning, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;festive color. Still, less than a&nbsp;decade later, white became widely accepted and started to&nbsp;be&nbsp;associated with purity and innocence instead.</p><p>A&nbsp;bit more about weddings. Typically, engagement and wedding rings are worn on&nbsp;the fourth finger, and the tradition goes back to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt, Rome, and <a href=# title=Greece data-link=tag>Greece</a>. People were wearing their rings on&nbsp;that finger because they believed that there was a&nbsp;vein in&nbsp;this particular finger that led straight to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=heart data-link=tag>heart</a>. Wearing a&nbsp;ring on&nbsp;this finger symbolized that the heart of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person was taken.</p><p>Originally, the ring was worn on&nbsp;the right hand because people believed the left hand to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unlucky. Some cultures changed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the left hand later. In&nbsp;some countries, people wear their engagement ring on&nbsp;the right hand before the wedding and switch it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the left after the wedding. But it’s always the fourth finger. Now we&nbsp;know that there’s no&nbsp;vein leading to&nbsp;the heart, but the tradition remained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9c5/693/c5b08f5ab39623541ea8d53532.png><p>Almost everywhere in&nbsp;the world, <a href=# title=pink data-link=tag>pink</a> is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;“girl color,” and blue is&nbsp;traditionally a&nbsp;“boy color.” I&nbsp;was wondering why it&nbsp;was like that, so&nbsp;I did a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;digging. Turns out that, originally, it&nbsp;was vice versa&nbsp;— as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“stronger” color, pink was associated with boys, and blue, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;calmer color, was assigned to&nbsp;girls. Later, the colors were reassigned as&nbsp;pink was seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;shade of&nbsp;“romantic” red.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 19th century, the women’s movement almost put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;assigning colors to&nbsp;genders. But then there were the 1960s when people learned how to&nbsp;figure out the gender of&nbsp;the future baby and started throwing gender reveal parties. Companies figured that they could make money by&nbsp;selling pink and blue gendered items. And that’s how they established the rule “blue is&nbsp;for boys, and pink is&nbsp;for girls.”</p><p>The “blue raspberry” flavor. Or&nbsp;more like the regular raspberry because blue raspberries just don’t exist. But for some reason, raspberry-flavored ice pop is&nbsp;blue. Why is&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;if&nbsp;the berry itself is&nbsp;pink or&nbsp;red? Well, for practical reasons and to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;less confusing.</p><p>Imagine you are producing a&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;popsicles and assigning colors to&nbsp;flavors. An&nbsp;apple-flavored one will probably be&nbsp;green; a&nbsp;lemon one will be&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;— that’s easy. Then there’s strawberry, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;red. Also, cherry&nbsp;— well, red again. Watermelon? Red. And now raspberry&nbsp;— red one more time. Wait, four reds are too many reds; how will people tell them apart? So, raspberry ice pops were made blue and got called a&nbsp;non-existent “blue raspberry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0e0/352/3db97954bf85447859b7aa040b.png><p>Okay, now, the egg mystery. Like why are some of&nbsp;them white and some brown, and what does it&nbsp;depend&nbsp;on? Apparently, the color depends on&nbsp;the breed of&nbsp;the hen: typically, white chickens lay white eggs, and dark chickens lay brown eggs.</p><p>But even chickens of&nbsp;the same breed can lay eggs of&nbsp;different colors, depending on&nbsp;the genetics of&nbsp;the particular hen. If&nbsp;you wonder if&nbsp;there’s any difference between brown and white eggs, then the answer is&nbsp;no&nbsp;— it’s just the color of&nbsp;the shell, nothing more.</p><p>The yolk can look different, too&nbsp;— yellow or&nbsp;orange. Its color depends on&nbsp;the food the chicken eats. If&nbsp;its diet has a&nbsp;big amount of&nbsp;yellow-orange pigments, then the yolk will be&nbsp;darker. Again, there’s no&nbsp;difference here other than the color, so&nbsp;don’t worry about&nbsp;it.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYypqaKrn6Oys7%2BMsJyaql2kv6K6xp5ko62dpcC2tdOsZHFpZGqBdHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-prisoners-wear-orange-jumpsuits-814543.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-prisoners-wear-orange-jumpsuits-814543.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-prisoners-wear-orange-jumpsuits-814543.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-prisoners-wear-orange-jumpsuits-814543.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-prisoners-wear-orange-jumpsuits-814543.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-prisoners-wear-orange-jumpsuits-814543.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-some-of-your-body-hair-can-grow-absurdly-long-798232.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-some-of-your-body-hair-can-grow-absurdly-long-798232.html>Why Some of Your Body Hair Can Grow Absurdly Long</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./australia-deportation-jack-black-tenacious-d-kyle-gass-trump-shooting.html>Tenacious D Stirs Controversy in Australia Over Trump Remark</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./australia-deportation-jack-black-tenacious-d-kyle-gass-trump-shooting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
